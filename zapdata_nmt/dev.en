You know that it was because of a physical infirmity that I first announced the gospel to you ; 
though my condition put you to the test , you did not scorn or despise me , but welcomed me as an angel of God , as Christ Jesus . 
What has become of the goodwill you felt ? For I testify that , had it been possible , you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me . 
Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth ? 
They make much of you , but for no good purpose ; they want to exclude you , so that you may make much of them . 
It is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times , and not only when I am present with you . 
My little children , for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you , 
I wish I were present with you now and could change my tone , for I am perplexed about you . 
Tell me , you who desire to be subject to the law , will you not listen to the law ? 
For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman . 
One , the child of the slave , was born according to the flesh ; the other , the child of the free woman , was born through the promise . 
Now this is an allegory : these women are two covenants . One woman , in fact , is Hagar , from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery . 
Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children . 
But the other woman corresponds to the Jerusalem above ; she is free , and she is our mother . 
For it is written , " Rejoice , you childless one , you who bear no children , burst into song and shout , you who endure no birth pangs ; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than the children of the one who is married . " 
Now you , my friends , are children of the promise , like Isaac . 
But just as at that time the child who was born according to the flesh persecuted the child who was born according to the Spirit , so it is now also . 
But what does the scripture say ? " Drive out the slave and her child ; for the child of the slave will not share the inheritance with the child of the free woman . " 
So then , friends , we are children , not of the slave but of the free woman . 
For freedom Christ has set us free . Stand firm , therefore , and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery . 
Listen ! I , Paul , am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , Christ will be of no benefit to you . 
Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law . 
You who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ ; you have fallen away from grace . 
For through the Spirit , by faith , we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness . 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything ; the only thing that counts is faith working through love . 
You were running well ; who prevented you from obeying the truth ? 
Such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you . 
A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough . 
I am confident about you in the Lord that you will not think otherwise . But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty . 
But my friends , why am I still being persecuted if I am still preaching circumcision ? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed . 
I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves ! 
For you were called to freedom , brothers and sisters ; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self - indulgence , but through love become slaves to one another . 
For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself . " 
If , however , you bite and devour one another , take care that you are not consumed by one another . 
Live by the Spirit , I say , and do not gratify the desires of the flesh . 
For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit , and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh ; for these are opposed to each other , to prevent you from doing what you want . 
But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not subject to the law . 
Now the works of the flesh are obvious : fornication , impurity , licentiousness , 
idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousy , anger , quarrels , dissensions , factions , 
envy , drunkenness , carousing , and things like these . I am warning you , as I warned you before : those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God . 
By contrast , the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , generosity , faithfulness , 
gentleness , and self - control . There is no law against such things . 
And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires . 
If we live by the Spirit , let us also be guided by the Spirit . 
Let us not become conceited , competing against one another , envying one another . 
My friends , if anyone is detected in a transgression , you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness . Take care that you yourselves are not tempted . 
Bear one another's burdens , and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ . 
For if those who are nothing think they are something , they deceive themselves . 
All must test their own work ; then that work , rather than their neighbor's work , will become a cause for pride . 
For all must carry their own loads . 
Those who are taught the word must share in all good things with their teacher . 
Do not be deceived ; God is not mocked , for you reap whatever you sow . 
If you sow to your own flesh , you will reap corruption from the flesh ; but if you sow to the Spirit , you will reap eternal life from the Spirit . 
So let us not grow weary in doing what is right , for we will reap at harvest time , if we do not give up . 
So then , whenever we have an opportunity , let us work for the good of all , and especially for those of the family of faith . 
See what large letters I make when I am writing in my own hand ! 
It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh that try to compel you to be circumcised - - only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ . 
Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the law , but they want you to be circumcised so that they may boast about your flesh . 
May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by which the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world . 
For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything ; but a new creation is everything ! 
As for those who will follow this rule - - peace be upon them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God . 
From now on , let no one make trouble for me ; for I carry the marks of Jesus branded on my body . 
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers and sisters . Amen . 
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , To the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus : 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places , 
just as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love . 
He destined us for adoption as his children through Jesus Christ , according to the good pleasure of his will , 
to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved . 
In him we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace
that he lavished on us . With all wisdom and insight
he has made known to us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure that he set forth in Christ , 
as a plan for the fullness of time , to gather up all things in him , things in heaven and things on earth . 
In Christ we have also obtained an inheritance , having been destined according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will , 
so that we , who were the first to set our hope on Christ , might live for the praise of his glory . 
In him you also , when you had heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation , and had believed in him , were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit ; 
this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as God's own people , to the praise of his glory . 
I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints , and for this reason
I do not cease to give thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers . 
I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation as you come to know him , 
so that , with the eyes of your heart enlightened , you may know what is the hope to which he has called you , what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints , 
and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power for us who believe , according to the working of his great power . 
God put this power to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places , 
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion , and above every name that is named , not only in this age but also in the age to come . 
And he has put all things under his feet and has made him the head over all things for the church , 
which is his body , the fullness of him who fills all in all . 
You were dead through the trespasses and sins
in which you once lived , following the course of this world , following the ruler of the power of the air , the spirit that is now at work among those who are disobedient . 
All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh , following the desires of flesh and senses , and we were by nature children of wrath , like everyone else . 
But God , who is rich in mercy , out of the great love with which he loved us
even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ - - by grace you have been saved - - 
and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus , 
so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus . 
For by grace you have been saved through faith , and this is not your own doing ; it is the gift of God - - 
not the result of works , so that no one may boast . 
For we are what he has made us , created in Christ Jesus for good works , which God prepared beforehand to be our way of life . 
So then , remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth , called " the uncircumcision " by those who are called " the circumcision " - - a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands - - 
remember that you were at that time without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of promise , having no hope and without God in the world . 
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ . 
For he is our peace ; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall , that is , the hostility between us . 
He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances , that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two , thus making peace , 
and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross , thus putting to death that hostility through it . 
So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near ; 
for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father . 
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens , but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God , 
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone . 
In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord ; 
in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God . 
This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles - - 
for surely you have already heard of the commission of God's grace that was given me for you , 
and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation , as I wrote above in a few words , 
a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ . 
In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind , as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit : 
that is , the Gentiles have become fellow heirs , members of the same body , and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel . 
Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power . 
Although I am the very least of all the saints , this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ , 
and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things ; 
so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places . 
This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord , 
in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him . 
I pray therefore that you may not lose heart over my sufferings for you ; they are your glory . 
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father , 
from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name . 
I pray that , according to the riches of his glory , he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his Spirit , 
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith , as you are being rooted and grounded in love . 
I pray that you may have the power to comprehend , with all the saints , what is the breadth and length and height and depth , 
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God . 
Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine , 
to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations , forever and ever . Amen . 
I therefore , the prisoner in the Lord , beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called , 
with all humility and gentleness , with patience , bearing with one another in love , 
making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace . 
There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called to the one hope of your calling , 
one Lord , one faith , one baptism , 
one God and Father of all , who is above all and through all and in all . 
But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ's gift . 
Therefore it is said , " When he ascended on high he made captivity itself a captive ; he gave gifts to his people . " 
( When it says , " He ascended , " what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth ? 
He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens , so that he might fill all things . ) 
The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , some pastors and teachers , 
to equip the saints for the work of ministry , for building up the body of Christ , 
until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to maturity , to the measure of the full stature of Christ . 
We must no longer be children , tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind of doctrine , by people's trickery , by their craftiness in deceitful scheming . 
But speaking the truth in love , we must grow up in every way into him who is the head , into Christ , 
from whom the whole body , joined and knit together by every ligament with which it is equipped , as each part is working properly , promotes the body's growth in building itself up in love . 
Now this I affirm and insist on in the Lord : you must no longer live as the Gentiles live , in the futility of their minds . 
They are darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart . 
They have lost all sensitivity and have abandoned themselves to licentiousness , greedy to practice every kind of impurity . 
That is not the way you learned Christ ! 
For surely you have heard about him and were taught in him , as truth is in Jesus . 
You were taught to put away your former way of life , your old self , corrupt and deluded by its lusts , 
and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds , 
and to clothe yourselves with the new self , created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness . 
So then , putting away falsehood , let all of us speak the truth to our neighbors , for we are members of one another . 
Be angry but do not sin ; do not let the sun go down on your anger , 
and do not make room for the devil . 
Thieves must give up stealing ; rather let them labor and work honestly with their own hands , so as to have something to share with the needy . 
Let no evil talk come out of your mouths , but only what is useful for building up , as there is need , so that your words may give grace to those who hear . 
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , with which you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption . 
Put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander , together with all malice , 
and be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , as God in Christ has forgiven you . 
Therefore be imitators of God , as beloved children , 
and live in love , as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us , a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God . 
But fornication and impurity of any kind , or greed , must not even be mentioned among you , as is proper among saints . 
Entirely out of place is obscene , silly , and vulgar talk ; but instead , let there be thanksgiving . 
Be sure of this , that no fornicator or impure person , or one who is greedy ( that is , an idolater ) , has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God . 
Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these things the wrath of God comes on those who are disobedient . 
Therefore do not be associated with them . 
For once you were darkness , but now in the Lord you are light . Live as children of light - - 
for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true . 
Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord . 
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness , but instead expose them . 
For it is shameful even to mention what such people do secretly ; 
but everything exposed by the light becomes visible , 
for everything that becomes visible is light . Therefore it says , " Sleeper , awake ! Rise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . " 
Be careful then how you live , not as unwise people but as wise , 
making the most of the time , because the days are evil . 
So do not be foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is . 
Do not get drunk with wine , for that is debauchery ; but be filled with the Spirit , 
as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves , singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts , 
giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . 
Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ . 
Wives , be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord . 
For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church , the body of which he is the Savior . 
Just as the church is subject to Christ , so also wives ought to be , in everything , to their husbands . 
Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her , 
in order to make her holy by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word , 
so as to present the church to himself in splendor , without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind - - yes , so that she may be holy and without blemish . 
In the same way , husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself . 
For no one ever hates his own body , but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it , just as Christ does for the church , 
because we are members of his body . 
" For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two will become one flesh . " 
This is a great mystery , and I am applying it to Christ and the church . 
Each of you , however , should love his wife as himself , and a wife should respect her husband . 
Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right . 
" Honor your father and mother " - - this is the first commandment with a promise : 
" so that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth . " 
And , fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord . 
Slaves , obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling , in singleness of heart , as you obey Christ ; 
not only while being watched , and in order to please them , but as slaves of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart . 
Render service with enthusiasm , as to the Lord and not to men and women , 
knowing that whatever good we do , we will receive the same again from the Lord , whether we are slaves or free . 
And , masters , do the same to them . Stop threatening them , for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven , and with him there is no partiality . 
Finally , be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power . 
Put on the whole armor of God , so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil . 
For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the cosmic powers of this present darkness , against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places . 
Therefore take up the whole armor of God , so that you may be able to withstand on that evil day , and having done everything , to stand firm . 
Stand therefore , and fasten the belt of truth around your waist , and put on the breastplate of righteousness . 
As shoes for your feet put on whatever will make you ready to proclaim the gospel of peace . 
With all of these , take the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one . 
Take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God . 
Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication . To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints . 
Pray also for me , so that when I speak , a message may be given to me to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel , 
for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may declare it boldly , as I must speak . 
So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing , Tychicus will tell you everything . He is a dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord . 
I am sending him to you for this very purpose , to let you know how we are , and to encourage your hearts . 
Peace be to the whole community , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 
Grace be with all who have an undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ . 
Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus , To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi , with the bishops and deacons : 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 
I thank my God every time I remember you , 
constantly praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you , 
because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now . 
I am confident of this , that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Jesus Christ . 
It is right for me to think this way about all of you , because you hold me in your heart , for all of you share in God's grace with me , both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel . 
For God is my witness , how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus . 
And this is my prayer , that your love may overflow more and more with knowledge and full insight
to help you to determine what is best , so that in the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless , 
having produced the harvest of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God . 
I want you to know , beloved , that what has happened to me has actually helped to spread the gospel , 
so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for Christ ; 
and most of the brothers and sisters , having been made confident in the Lord by my imprisonment , dare to speak the word with greater boldness and without fear . 
Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry , but others from goodwill . 
These proclaim Christ out of love , knowing that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel ; 
the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition , not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment . 
What does it matter ? Just this , that Christ is proclaimed in every way , whether out of false motives or true ; and in that I rejoice . Yes , and I will continue to rejoice , 
for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance . 
It is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in any way , but that by my speaking with all boldness , Christ will be exalted now as always in my body , whether by life or by death . 
For to me , living is Christ and dying is gain . 
If I am to live in the flesh , that means fruitful labor for me ; and I do not know which I prefer . 
I am hard pressed between the two : my desire is to depart and be with Christ , for that is far better ; 
but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you . 
Since I am convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith , 
so that I may share abundantly in your boasting in Christ Jesus when I come to you again . 
Only , live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that , whether I come and see you or am absent and hear about you , I will know that you are standing firm in one spirit , striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel , 
and are in no way intimidated by your opponents . For them this is evidence of their destruction , but of your salvation . And this is God's doing . 
For he has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in Christ , but of suffering for him as well - - 
since you are having the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I still have . 
If then there is any encouragement in Christ , any consolation from love , any sharing in the Spirit , any compassion and sympathy , 
make my joy complete : be of the same mind , having the same love , being in full accord and of one mind . 
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit , but in humility regard others as better than yourselves . 
Let each of you look not to your own interests , but to the interests of others . 
Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus , 
who , though he was in the form of God , did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited , 
but emptied himself , taking the form of a slave , being born in human likeness . And being found in human form , 
he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death - - even death on a cross . 
Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name , 
so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend , in heaven and on earth and under the earth , 
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father . 
Therefore , my beloved , just as you have always obeyed me , not only in my presence , but much more now in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling ; 
for it is God who is at work in you , enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure . 
Do all things without murmuring and arguing , 
so that you may be blameless and innocent , children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation , in which you shine like stars in the world . 
It is by your holding fast to the word of life that I can boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain . 
But even if I am being poured out as a libation over the sacrifice and the offering of your faith , I am glad and rejoice with all of you - - 
and in the same way you also must be glad and rejoice with me . 
I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , so that I may be cheered by news of you . 
I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare . 
All of them are seeking their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ . 
But Timothy's worth you know , how like a son with a father he has served with me in the work of the gospel . 
I hope therefore to send him as soon as I see how things go with me ; 
and I trust in the Lord that I will also come soon . 
Still , I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus - - my brother and co - worker and fellow soldier , your messenger and minister to my need ; 
for he has been longing for all of you , and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill . 
He was indeed so ill that he nearly died . But God had mercy on him , and not only on him but on me also , so that I would not have one sorrow after another . 
I am the more eager to send him , therefore , in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again , and that I may be less anxious . 
Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy , and honor such people , 
because he came close to death for the work of Christ , risking his life to make up for those services that you could not give me . 
Finally , my brothers and sisters , rejoice in the Lord . To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me , and for you it is a safeguard . 
Beware of the dogs , beware of the evil workers , beware of those who mutilate the flesh ! 
For it is we who are the circumcision , who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh - - 
even though I , too , have reason for confidence in the flesh . If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh , I have more : 
circumcised on the eighth day , a member of the people of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew born of Hebrews ; as to the law , a Pharisee ; 
as to zeal , a persecutor of the church ; as to righteousness under the law , blameless . 
Yet whatever gains I had , these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ . 
More than that , I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things , and I regard them as rubbish , in order that I may gain Christ
and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law , but one that comes through faith in Christ , the righteousness from God based on faith . 
I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death , 
if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead . 
Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal ; but I press on to make it my own , because Christ Jesus has made me his own . 
Beloved , I do not consider that I have made it my own ; but this one thing I do : forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead , 
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus . 
Let those of us then who are mature be of the same mind ; and if you think differently about anything , this too God will reveal to you . 
Only let us hold fast to what we have attained . 
Brothers and sisters , join in imitating me , and observe those who live according to the example you have in us . 
For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ ; I have often told you of them , and now I tell you even with tears . 
Their end is destruction ; their god is the belly ; and their glory is in their shame ; their minds are set on earthly things . 
But our citizenship is in heaven , and it is from there that we are expecting a Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ . 
He will transform the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory , by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself . 
Therefore , my brothers and sisters , whom I love and long for , my joy and crown , stand firm in the Lord in this way , my beloved . 
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord . 
Yes , and I ask you also , my loyal companion , help these women , for they have struggled beside me in the work of the gospel , together with Clement and the rest of my co - workers , whose names are in the book of life . 
Rejoice in the Lord always ; again I will say , Rejoice . 
Let your gentleness be known to everyone . The Lord is near . 
Do not worry about anything , but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God . 
And the peace of God , which surpasses all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus . 
Finally , beloved , whatever is true , whatever is honorable , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is pleasing , whatever is commendable , if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise , think about these things . 
Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me , and the God of peace will be with you . 
I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me ; indeed , you were concerned for me , but had no opportunity to show it . 
Not that I am referring to being in need ; for I have learned to be content with whatever I have . 
I know what it is to have little , and I know what it is to have plenty . In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of being well - fed and of going hungry , of having plenty and of being in need . 
I can do all things through him who strengthens me . 
In any case , it was kind of you to share my distress . 
You Philippians indeed know that in the early days of the gospel , when I left Macedonia , no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving , except you alone . 
For even when I was in Thessalonica , you sent me help for my needs more than once . 
Not that I seek the gift , but I seek the profit that accumulates to your account . 
I have been paid in full and have more than enough ; I am fully satisfied , now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent , a fragrant offering , a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God . 
And my God will fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus . 
To our God and Father be glory forever and ever . Amen . 
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus . The friends who are with me greet you . 
All the saints greet you , especially those of the emperor's household . 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . 
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , 
To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ in Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father . 
In our prayers for you we always thank God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , 
for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints , 
because of the hope laid up for you in heaven . You have heard of this hope before in the word of the truth , the gospel
that has come to you . Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world , so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God . 
This you learned from Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant . He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf , 
and he has made known to us your love in the Spirit . 
For this reason , since the day we heard it , we have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding , 
so that you may lead lives worthy of the Lord , fully pleasing to him , as you bear fruit in every good work and as you grow in the knowledge of God . 
May you be made strong with all the strength that comes from his glorious power , and may you be prepared to endure everything with patience , while joyfully
giving thanks to the Father , who has enabled you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light . 
He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son , 
in whom we have redemption , the forgiveness of sins . 
He is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation ; 
for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created , things visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers - - all things have been created through him and for him . 
He himself is before all things , and in him all things hold together . 
He is the head of the body , the church ; he is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead , so that he might come to have first place in everything . 
For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell , 
and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things , whether on earth or in heaven , by making peace through the blood of his cross . 
And you who were once estranged and hostile in mind , doing evil deeds , 
he has now reconciled in his fleshly body through death , so as to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before him - - 
provided that you continue securely established and steadfast in the faith , without shifting from the hope promised by the gospel that you heard , which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven . I , Paul , became a servant of this gospel . 
I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake , and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body , that is , the church . 
I became its servant according to God's commission that was given to me for you , to make the word of God fully known , 
the mystery that has been hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints . 
To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory . 
It is he whom we proclaim , warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom , so that we may present everyone mature in Christ . 
For this I toil and struggle with all the energy that he powerfully inspires within me . 
For I want you to know how much I am struggling for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for all who have not seen me face to face . 
I want their hearts to be encouraged and united in love , so that they may have all the riches of assured understanding and have the knowledge of God's mystery , that is , Christ himself , 
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . 
I am saying this so that no one may deceive you with plausible arguments . 
For though I am absent in body , yet I am with you in spirit , and I rejoice to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in Christ . 
As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord , continue to live your lives in him , 
rooted and built up in him and established in the faith , just as you were taught , abounding in thanksgiving . 
See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit , according to human tradition , according to the elemental spirits of the universe , and not according to Christ . 
For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily , 
and you have come to fullness in him , who is the head of every ruler and authority . 
In him also you were circumcised with a spiritual circumcision , by putting off the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ ; 
when you were buried with him in baptism , you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God , who raised him from the dead . 
And when you were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh , God made you alive together with him , when he forgave us all our trespasses , 
erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands . He set this aside , nailing it to the cross . 
He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public example of them , triumphing over them in it . 
Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or of observing festivals , new moons , or sabbaths . 
These are only a shadow of what is to come , but the substance belongs to Christ . 
Do not let anyone disqualify you , insisting on self - abasement and worship of angels , dwelling on visions , puffed up without cause by a human way of thinking , 
and not holding fast to the head , from whom the whole body , nourished and held together by its ligaments and sinews , grows with a growth that is from God . 
If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe , why do you live as if you still belonged to the world ? Why do you submit to regulations , 
" Do not handle , Do not taste , Do not touch " ? 
All these regulations refer to things that perish with use ; they are simply human commands and teachings . 
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self - imposed piety , humility , and severe treatment of the body , but they are of no value in checking self - indulgence . 
So if you have been raised with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated at the right hand of God . 
Set your minds on things that are above , not on things that are on earth , 
for you have died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God . 
When Christ who is your life is revealed , then you also will be revealed with him in glory . 
Put to death , therefore , whatever in you is earthly : fornication , impurity , passion , evil desire , and greed ( which is idolatry ) . 
On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient . 
These are the ways you also once followed , when you were living that life . 
But now you must get rid of all such things - - anger , wrath , malice , slander , and abusive language from your mouth . 
Do not lie to one another , seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices
and have clothed yourselves with the new self , which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator . 
In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , barbarian , Scythian , slave and free ; but Christ is all and in all ! 
As God's chosen ones , holy and beloved , clothe yourselves with compassion , kindness , humility , meekness , and patience . 
Bear with one another and , if anyone has a complaint against another , forgive each other ; just as the Lord has forgiven you , so you also must forgive . 
Above all , clothe yourselves with love , which binds everything together in perfect harmony . 
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts , to which indeed you were called in the one body . And be thankful . 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly ; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom ; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs to God . 
And whatever you do , in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father through him . 
Wives , be subject to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord . 
Husbands , love your wives and never treat them harshly . 
Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is your acceptable duty in the Lord . 
Fathers , do not provoke your children , or they may lose heart . 
Slaves , obey your earthly masters in everything , not only while being watched and in order to please them , but wholeheartedly , fearing the Lord . 
Whatever your task , put yourselves into it , as done for the Lord and not for your masters , 
since you know that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward ; you serve the Lord Christ . 
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for whatever wrong has been done , and there is no partiality . 
Masters , treat your slaves justly and fairly , for you know that you also have a Master in heaven . 
Devote yourselves to prayer , keeping alert in it with thanksgiving . 
At the same time pray for us as well that God will open to us a door for the word , that we may declare the mystery of Christ , for which I am in prison , 
so that I may reveal it clearly , as I should . 
Conduct yourselves wisely toward outsiders , making the most of the time . 
Let your speech always be gracious , seasoned with salt , so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone . 
Tychicus will tell you all the news about me ; he is a beloved brother , a faithful minister , and a fellow servant in the Lord . 
I have sent him to you for this very purpose , so that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts ; 
he is coming with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will tell you about everything here . 
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you , as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas , concerning whom you have received instructions - - if he comes to you , welcome him . 
And Jesus who is called Justus greets you . These are the only ones of the circumcision among my co - workers for the kingdom of God , and they have been a comfort to me . 
Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ Jesus , greets you . He is always wrestling in his prayers on your behalf , so that you may stand mature and fully assured in everything that God wills . 
For I testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis . 
Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas greet you . 
Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea , and to Nympha and the church in her house . 
And when this letter has been read among you , have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and see that you read also the letter from Laodicea . 
And say to Archippus , " See that you complete the task that you have received in the Lord . " 
I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . Remember my chains . Grace be with you . 
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace . 
We always give thanks to God for all of you and mention you in our prayers , constantly
remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ . 
For we know , brothers and sisters beloved by God , that he has chosen you , 
because our message of the gospel came to you not in word only , but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction ; just as you know what kind of persons we proved to be among you for your sake . 
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord , for in spite of persecution you received the word with joy inspired by the Holy Spirit , 
so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia . 
For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but in every place your faith in God has become known , so that we have no need to speak about it . 
For the people of those regions report about us what kind of welcome we had among you , and how you turned to God from idols , to serve a living and true God , 
and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead - - Jesus , who rescues us from the wrath that is coming . 
You yourselves know , brothers and sisters , that our coming to you was not in vain , 
but though we had already suffered and been shamefully mistreated at Philippi , as you know , we had courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of great opposition . 
For our appeal does not spring from deceit or impure motives or trickery , 
but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the message of the gospel , even so we speak , not to please mortals , but to please God who tests our hearts . 
As you know and as God is our witness , we never came with words of flattery or with a pretext for greed ; 
nor did we seek praise from mortals , whether from you or from others , 
though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ . But we were gentle among you , like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children . 
So deeply do we care for you that we are determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves , because you have become very dear to us . 
You remember our labor and toil , brothers and sisters ; we worked night and day , so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God . 
You are witnesses , and God also , how pure , upright , and blameless our conduct was toward you believers . 
As you know , we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children , 
urging and encouraging you and pleading that you lead a life worthy of God , who calls you into his own kingdom and glory . 
We also constantly give thanks to God for this , that when you received the word of God that you heard from us , you accepted it not as a human word but as what it really is , God's word , which is also at work in you believers . 
For you , brothers and sisters , became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea , for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the Jews , 
who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and drove us out ; they displease God and oppose everyone 
by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved . Thus they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins ; but God's wrath has overtaken them at last . 
As for us , brothers and sisters , when , for a short time , we were made orphans by being separated from you - - in person , not in heart - - we longed with great eagerness to see you face to face . 
For we wanted to come to you - - certainly I , Paul , wanted to again and again - - but Satan blocked our way . 
For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming ? Is it not you ? 
Yes , you are our glory and joy ! 
Therefore when we could bear it no longer , we decided to be left alone in Athens ; 
and we sent Timothy , our brother and co - worker for God in proclaiming the gospel of Christ , to strengthen and encourage you for the sake of your faith , 
so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions . Indeed , you yourselves know that this is what we are destined for . 
In fact , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we were to suffer persecution ; so it turned out , as you know . 
For this reason , when I could bear it no longer , I sent to find out about your faith ; I was afraid that somehow the tempter had tempted you and that our labor had been in vain . 
But Timothy has just now come to us from you , and has brought us the good news of your faith and love . He has told us also that you always remember us kindly and long to see us - - just as we long to see you . 
For this reason , brothers and sisters , during all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you through your faith . 
For we now live , if you continue to stand firm in the Lord . 
How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we feel before our God because of you ? 
Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and restore whatever is lacking in your faith . 
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you . 
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all , just as we abound in love for you . 
And may he so strengthen your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints . 
Finally , brothers and sisters , we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus that , as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God ( as , in fact , you are doing ) , you should do so more and more . 
For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus . 
For this is the will of God , your sanctification : that you abstain from fornication ; 
that each one of you know how to control your own body in holiness and honor , 
not with lustful passion , like the Gentiles who do not know God ; 
that no one wrong or exploit a brother or sister in this matter , because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , just as we have already told you beforehand and solemnly warned you . 
For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness . 
Therefore whoever rejects this rejects not human authority but God , who also gives his Holy Spirit to you . 
Now concerning love of the brothers and sisters , you do not need to have anyone write to you , for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another ; 
and indeed you do love all the brothers and sisters throughout Macedonia . But we urge you , beloved , to do so more and more , 
to aspire to live quietly , to mind your own affairs , and to work with your hands , as we directed you , 
so that you may behave properly toward outsiders and be dependent on no one . 
But we do not want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , about those who have died , so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope . 
For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so , through Jesus , God will bring with him those who have died . 
For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will by no means precede those who have died . 
For the Lord himself , with a cry of command , with the archangel's call and with the sound of God's trumpet , will descend from heaven , and the dead in Christ will rise first . 
Then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air ; and so we will be with the Lord forever . 
Therefore encourage one another with these words . 
Now concerning the times and the seasons , brothers and sisters , you do not need to have anything written to you . 
For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night . 
When they say , " There is peace and security , " then sudden destruction will come upon them , as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman , and there will be no escape ! 
But you , beloved , are not in darkness , for that day to surprise you like a thief ; 
for you are all children of light and children of the day ; we are not of the night or of darkness . 
So then let us not fall asleep as others do , but let us keep awake and be sober ; 
for those who sleep sleep at night , and those who are drunk get drunk at night . 
But since we belong to the day , let us be sober , and put on the breastplate of faith and love , and for a helmet the hope of salvation . 
For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ , 
who died for us , so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him . 
Therefore encourage one another and build up each other , as indeed you are doing . 
But we appeal to you , brothers and sisters , to respect those who labor among you , and have charge of you in the Lord and admonish you ; 
esteem them very highly in love because of their work . Be at peace among yourselves . 
And we urge you , beloved , to admonish the idlers , encourage the faint hearted , help the weak , be patient with all of them . 
See that none of you repays evil for evil , but always seek to do good to one another and to all . 
Rejoice always , 
pray without ceasing , 
give thanks in all circumstances ; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you . 
Do not quench the Spirit . 
Do not despise the words of prophets , 
but test everything ; hold fast to what is good ; 
abstain from every form of evil . 
May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely ; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . 
The one who calls you is faithful , and he will do this . 
Beloved , pray for us . 
Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss . 
I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all of them . 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . 
Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 
We must always give thanks to God for you , brothers and sisters , as is right , because your faith is growing abundantly , and the love of everyone of you for one another is increasing . 
Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith during all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring . 
This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God , and is intended to make you worthy of the kingdom of God , for which you are also suffering . 
For it is indeed just of God to repay with affliction those who afflict you , 
and to give relief to the afflicted as well as to us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
in flaming fire , inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus . 
These will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction , separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might , 
when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at on that day among all who have believed , because our testimony to you was believed . 
To this end we always pray for you , asking that our God will make you worthy of his call and will fulfill by his power every good resolve and work of faith , 
so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ . 
As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him , we beg you , brothers and sisters , 
not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed , either by spirit or by word or by letter , as though from us , to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here . 
Let no one deceive you in any way ; for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed , the one destined for destruction . 
He opposes and exalts himself above every so - called god or object of worship , so that he takes his seat in the temple of God , declaring himself to be God . 
Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you ? 
And you know what is now restraining him , so that he may be revealed when his time comes . 
For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work , but only until the one who now restrains it is removed . 
And then the lawless one will be revealed , whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breath of his mouth , annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming . 
The coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of Satan , who uses all power , signs , lying wonders , 
and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing , because they refused to love the truth and so be saved . 
For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion , leading them to believe what is false , 
so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned . 
But we must always give thanks to God for you , brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord , because God chose you as the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through belief in the truth . 
For this purpose he called you through our proclamation of the good news , so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ . 
So then , brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us , either by word of mouth or by our letter . 
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father , who loved us and through grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope , 
comfort your hearts and strengthen them in every good work and word . 
Finally , brothers and sisters , pray for us , so that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified everywhere , just as it is among you , 
and that we may be rescued from wicked and evil people ; for not all have faith . 
But the Lord is faithful ; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one . 
And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you are doing and will go on doing the things that we command . 
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ . 
Now we command you , beloved , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not according to the tradition that they received from us . 
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us ; we were not idle when we were with you , 
and we did not eat anyone's bread without paying for it ; but with toil and labor we worked night and day , so that we might not burden any of you . 
This was not because we do not have that right , but in order to give you an example to imitate . 
For even when we were with you , we gave you this command : Anyone unwilling to work should not eat . 
For we hear that some of you are living in idleness , mere busybodies , not doing any work . 
Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living . 
Brothers and sisters , do not be weary in doing what is right . 
Take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter ; have nothing to do with them , so that they may be ashamed . 
Do not regard them as enemies , but warn them as believers . 
Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . The Lord be with all of you . 
I , Paul , write this greeting with my own hand . This is the mark in every letter of mine ; it is the way I write . 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you . 
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope , 
To Timothy , my loyal child in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . 
I urge you , as I did when I was on my way to Macedonia , to remain in Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach any different doctrine , 
and not to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies that promote speculations rather than the divine training that is known by faith . 
But the aim of such instruction is love that comes from a pure heart , a good conscience , and sincere faith . 
Some people have deviated from these and turned to meaningless talk , 
desiring to be teachers of the law , without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make assertions . 
Now we know that the law is good , if one uses it legitimately . 
This means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient , for the godless and sinful , for the unholy and profane , for those who kill their father or mother , for murderers , 
fornicators , sodomites , slave traders , liars , perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching
that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which he entrusted to me . 
I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord , who has strengthened me , because he judged me faithful and appointed me to his service , 
even though I was formerly a blasphemer , a persecutor , and a man of violence . But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief , 
and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus . 
The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners - - of whom I am the foremost . 
But for that very reason I received mercy , so that in me , as the foremost , Jesus Christ might display the utmost patience , making me an example to those who would come to believe in him for eternal life . 
To the King of the ages , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen . 
I am giving you these instructions , Timothy , my child , in accordance with the prophecies made earlier about you , so that by following them you may fight the good fight , 
having faith and a good conscience . By rejecting conscience , certain persons have suffered shipwreck in the faith ; 
among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have turned over to Satan , so that they may learn not to blaspheme . 
First of all , then , I urge that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for everyone , 
for kings and all who are in high positions , so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity . 
This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior , 
who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth . 
For there is one God ; there is also one mediator between God and humankind , Christ Jesus , himself human , 
who gave himself a ransom for all - - this was attested at the right time . 
For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle ( I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth . 
I desire , then , that in every place the men should pray , lifting up holy hands without anger or argument ; 
also that the women should dress themselves modestly and decently in suitable clothing , not with their hair braided , or with gold , pearls , or expensive clothes , 
but with good works , as is proper for women who profess reverence for God . 
Let a woman learn in silence with full submission . 
I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man ; she is to keep silent . 
For Adam was formed first , then Eve ; 
and Adam was not deceived , but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor . 
Yet she will be saved through childbearing , provided they continue in faith and love and holiness , with modesty . 
The saying is sure : whoever aspires to the office of bishop desires a noble task . 
Now a bishop must be above reproach , married only once , temperate , sensible , respectable , hospitable , an apt teacher , 
not a drunkard , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , and not a lover of money . 
He must manage his own household well , keeping his children submissive and respectful in every way - - 
for if someone does not know how to manage his own household , how can he take care of God's church ? 
He must not be a recent convert , or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil . 
Moreover , he must be well thought of by outsiders , so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare of the devil . 
Deacons likewise must be serious , not double - tongued , not indulging in much wine , not greedy for money ; 
they must hold fast to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience . 
And let them first be tested ; then , if they prove themselves blameless , let them serve as deacons . 
Women likewise must be serious , not slanderers , but temperate , faithful in all things . 
Let deacons be married only once , and let them manage their children and their households well ; 
for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus . 
I hope to come to you soon , but I am writing these instructions to you so that , 
if I am delayed , you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and bulwark of the truth . 
Without any doubt , the mystery of our religion is great : He was revealed in flesh , vindicated in spirit , seen by angels , proclaimed among Gentiles , believed in throughout the world , taken up in glory . 
Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will renounce the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons , 
through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared with a hot iron . 
They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods , which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth . 
For everything created by God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , provided it is received with thanksgiving ; 
for it is sanctified by God's word and by prayer . 
If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed . 
Have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives' tales . Train yourself in godliness , 
for , while physical training is of some value , godliness is valuable in every way , holding promise for both the present life and the life to come . 
The saying is sure and worthy of full acceptance . 
For to this end we toil and struggle , because we have our hope set on the living God , who is the Savior of all people , especially of those who believe . 
These are the things you must insist on and teach . 
Let no one despise your youth , but set the believers an example in speech and conduct , in love , in faith , in purity . 
Until I arrive , give attention to the public reading of scripture , to exhorting , to teaching . 
Do not neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders . 
Put these things into practice , devote yourself to them , so that all may see your progress . 
Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching ; continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and your hearers . 
Do not speak harshly to an older man , but speak to him as to a father , to younger men as brothers , 
to older women as mothers , to younger women as sisters - - with absolute purity . 
Honor widows who are really widows . 
If a widow has children or grandchildren , they should first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some repayment to their parents ; for this is pleasing in God's sight . 
The real widow , left alone , has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day ; 
but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives . 
Give these commands as well , so that they may be above reproach . 
And whoever does not provide for relatives , and especially for family members , has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever . 
Let a widow be put on the list if she is not less than sixty years old and has been married only once ; 
she must be well attested for her good works , as one who has brought up children , shown hospitality , washed the saints' feet , helped the afflicted , and devoted herself to doing good in every way . 
But refuse to put younger widows on the list ; for when their sensual desires alienate them from Christ , they want to marry , 
and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge . 
Besides that , they learn to be idle , gadding about from house to house ; and they are not merely idle , but also gossips and busybodies , saying what they should not say . 
So I would have younger widows marry , bear children , and manage their households , so as to give the adversary no occasion to revile us . 
For some have already turned away to follow Satan . 
If any believing woman has relatives who are really widows , let her assist them ; let the church not be burdened , so that it can assist those who are real widows . 
Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in preaching and teaching ; 
for the scripture says , " You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain , " and , " The laborer deserves to be paid . " 
Never accept any accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses . 
As for those who persist in sin , rebuke them in the presence of all , so that the rest also may stand in fear . 
In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels , I warn you to keep these instructions without prejudice , doing nothing on the basis of partiality . 
Do not ordain anyone hastily , and do not participate in the sins of others ; keep yourself pure . 
No longer drink only water , but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments . 
The sins of some people are conspicuous and precede them to judgment , while the sins of others follow them there . 
So also good works are conspicuous ; and even when they are not , they cannot remain hidden . 
Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor , so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed . 
Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church ; rather they must serve them all the more , since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved . Teach and urge these duties . 
Whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness , 
is conceited , understanding nothing , and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words . From these come envy , dissension , slander , base suspicions , 
and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth , imagining that godliness is a means of gain . 
Of course , there is great gain in godliness combined with contentment ; 
for we brought nothing into the world , so that we can take nothing out of it ; 
but if we have food and clothing , we will be content with these . 
But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction . 
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil , and in their eagerness to be rich some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains . 
But as for you , man of God , shun all this ; pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , endurance , gentleness . 
Fight the good fight of the faith ; take hold of the eternal life , to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses . 
In the presence of God , who gives life to all things , and of Christ Jesus , who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession , I charge you
to keep the commandment without spot or blame until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ , 
which he will bring about at the right time - - he who is the blessed and only Sovereign , the King of kings and Lord of lords . 
It is he alone who has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light , whom no one has ever seen or can see ; to him be honor and eternal dominion . Amen . 
As for those who in the present age are rich , command them not to be haughty , or to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches , but rather on God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment . 
They are to do good , to be rich in good works , generous , and ready to share , 
thus storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future , so that they may take hold of the life that really is life . 
Timothy , guard what has been entrusted to you . Avoid the profane chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge ; 
by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith . Grace be with you . 
Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , for the sake of the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus , 
To Timothy , my beloved child : Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . 
I am grateful to God - - whom I worship with a clear conscience , as my ancestors did - - when I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day . 
Recalling your tears , I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy . 
I am reminded of your sincere faith , a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now , I am sure , lives in you . 
For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands ; 
for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice , but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self - discipline . 
Do not be ashamed , then , of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner , but join with me in suffering for the gospel , relying on the power of God , 
who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace . This grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began , 
but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus , who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel . 
For this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher , 
and for this reason I suffer as I do . But I am not ashamed , for I know the one in whom I have put my trust , and I am sure that he is able to guard until that day what I have entrusted to him . 
Hold to the standard of sound teaching that you have heard from me , in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus . 
Guard the good treasure entrusted to you , with the help of the Holy Spirit living in us . 
You are aware that all who are in Asia have turned away from me , including Phygelus and Hermogenes . 
May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus , because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain ; 
when he arrived in Rome , he eagerly searched for me and found me 
- - may the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day ! And you know very well how much service he rendered in Ephesus . 
You then , my child , be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus ; 
and what you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well . 
Share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus . 
No one serving in the army gets entangled in everyday affairs ; the soldier's aim is to please the enlisting officer . 
And in the case of an athlete , no one is crowned without competing according to the rules . 
It is the farmer who does the work who ought to have the first share of the crops . 
Think over what I say , for the Lord will give you understanding in all things . 
Remember Jesus Christ , raised from the dead , a descendant of David - - that is my gospel , 
for which I suffer hardship , even to the point of being chained like a criminal . But the word of God is not chained . 
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect , so that they may also obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus , with eternal glory . 
The saying is sure : If we have died with him , we will also live with him ; 
if we endure , we will also reign with him ; if we deny him , he will also deny us ; 
if we are faithless , he remains faithful - - for he cannot deny himself . 
Remind them of this , and warn them before God that they are to avoid wrangling over words , which does no good but only ruins those who are listening . 
Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved by him , a worker who has no need to be ashamed , rightly explaining the word of truth . 
Avoid profane chatter , for it will lead people into more and more impiety , 
and their talk will spread like gangrene . Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus , 
who have swerved from the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place . They are upsetting the faith of some . 
But God's firm foundation stands , bearing this inscription : " The Lord knows those who are his , " and , " Let everyone who calls on the name of the Lord turn away from wickedness . " 
In a large house there are utensils not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay , some for special use , some for ordinary . 
All who cleanse themselves of the things I have mentioned will become special utensils , dedicated and useful to the owner of the house , ready for every good work . 
Shun youthful passions and pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace , along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart . 
Have nothing to do with stupid and senseless controversies ; you know that they breed quarrels . 
And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to everyone , an apt teacher , patient , 
correcting opponents with gentleness . God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth , 
and that they may escape from the snare of the devil , having been held captive by him to do his will . 
You must understand this , that in the last days distressing times will come . 
For people will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , boasters , arrogant , abusive , disobedient to their parents , ungrateful , unholy , 
inhuman , implacable , slanderers , profligates , brutes , haters of good , 
treacherous , reckless , swollen with conceit , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God , 
holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power . Avoid them ! 
For among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women , overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires , 
who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth . 
As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so these people , of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith , also oppose the truth . 
But they will not make much progress , because , as in the case of those two men , their folly will become plain to everyone . 
Now you have observed my teaching , my conduct , my aim in life , my faith , my patience , my love , my steadfastness , 
my persecutions and suffering the things that happened to me in Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . What persecutions I endured ! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them . 
Indeed , all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted . 
But wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse , deceiving others and being deceived . 
But as for you , continue in what you have learned and firmly believed , knowing from whom you learned it , 
and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus . 
All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness , 
so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient , equipped for every good work . 
In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus , who is to judge the living and the dead , and in view of his appearing and his kingdom , I solemnly urge you : 
proclaim the message ; be persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable ; convince , rebuke , and encourage , with the utmost patience in teaching . 
For the time is coming when people will not put up with sound doctrine , but having itching ears , they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires , 
and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander away to myths . 
As for you , always be sober , endure suffering , do the work of an evangelist , carry out your ministry fully . 
As for me , I am already being poured out as a libation , and the time of my departure has come . 
I have fought the good fight , I have finished the race , I have kept the faith . 
From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give me on that day , and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing . 
Do your best to come to me soon , 
for Demas , in love with this present world , has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica ; Crescens has gone to Galatia , Titus to Dalmatia . 
Only Luke is with me . Get Mark and bring him with you , for he is useful in my ministry . 
I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus . 
When you come , bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas , also the books , and above all the parchments . 
Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm ; the Lord will pay him back for his deeds . 
You also must beware of him , for he strongly opposed our message . 
At my first defense no one came to my support , but all deserted me . May it not be counted against them ! 
But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength , so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it . So I was rescued from the lion's mouth . 
The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom . To him be the glory forever and ever . Amen . 
Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus . 
Erastus remained in Corinth ; Trophimus I left ill in Miletus . 
Do your best to come before winter . Eubulus sends greetings to you , as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers and sisters . 
The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you . 
Paul , a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ , for the sake of the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that is in accordance with godliness , 
in the hope of eternal life that God , who never lies , promised before the ages began - - 
in due time he revealed his word through the proclamation with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior , 
To Titus , my loyal child in the faith we share : Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior . 
I left you behind in Crete for this reason , so that you should put in order what remained to be done , and should appoint elders in every town , as I directed you : 
someone who is blameless , married only once , whose children are believers , not accused of debauchery and not rebellious . 
For a bishop , as God's steward , must be blameless ; he must not be arrogant or quick - tempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for gain ; 
but he must be hospitable , a lover of goodness , prudent , upright , devout , and self - controlled . 
He must have a firm grasp of the word that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching , so that he may be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it . 
There are also many rebellious people , idle talkers and deceivers , especially those of the circumcision ; 
they must be silenced , since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for sordid gain what it is not right to teach . 
It was one of them , their very own prophet , who said , " Cretans are always liars , vicious brutes , lazy gluttons . " 
That testimony is true . For this reason rebuke them sharply , so that they may become sound in the faith , 
not paying attention to Jewish myths or to commandments of those who reject the truth . 
To the pure all things are pure , but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure . Their very minds and consciences are corrupted . 
They profess to know God , but they deny him by their actions . They are detestable , disobedient , unfit for any good work . 
But as for you , teach what is consistent with sound doctrine . 
Tell the older men to be temperate , serious , prudent , and sound in faith , in love , and in endurance . 
Likewise , tell the older women to be reverent in behavior , not to be slanderers or slaves to drink ; they are to teach what is good , 
so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands , to love their children , 
to be self - controlled , chaste , good managers of the household , kind , being submissive to their husbands , so that the word of God may not be discredited . 
Likewise , urge the younger men to be self - controlled . 
Show yourself in all respects a model of good works , and in your teaching show integrity , gravity , 
and sound speech that cannot be censured ; then any opponent will be put to shame , having nothing evil to say of us . 
Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect ; they are not to talk back , 
not to pilfer , but to show complete and perfect fidelity , so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior . 
For the grace of God has appeared , bringing salvation to all , 
training us to renounce impiety and worldly passions , and in the present age to live lives that are self - controlled , upright , and godly , 
while we wait for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ . 
He it is who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds . 
Declare these things ; exhort and reprove with all authority . Let no one look down on you . 
Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities , to be obedient , to be ready for every good work , 
to speak evil of no one , to avoid quarreling , to be gentle , and to show every courtesy to everyone . 
For we ourselves were once foolish , disobedient , led astray , slaves to various passions and pleasures , passing our days in malice and envy , despicable , hating one another . 
But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared , 
he saved us , not because of any works of righteousness that we had done , but according to his mercy , through the water of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit . 
This Spirit he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior , 
so that , having been justified by his grace , we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life . 
The saying is sure . I desire that you insist on these things , so that those who have come to believe in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works ; these things are excellent and profitable to everyone . 
But avoid stupid controversies , genealogies , dissensions , and quarrels about the law , for they are unprofitable and worthless . 
After a first and second admonition , have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions , 
since you know that such a person is perverted and sinful , being self - condemned . 
When I send Artemas to you , or Tychicus , do your best to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there . 
Make every effort to send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way , and see that they lack nothing . 
And let people learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet urgent needs , so that they may not be unproductive . 
All who are with me send greetings to you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with all of you . 
Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy our brother , To Philemon our dear friend and co - worker , 
to Apphia our sister , to Archippus our fellow soldier , and to the church in your house : 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 
When I remember you in my prayers , I always thank my God 
because I hear of your love for all the saints and your faith toward the Lord Jesus . 
I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective when you perceive all the good that we may do for Christ . 
I have indeed received much joy and encouragement from your love , because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you , my brother . 
For this reason , though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do your duty , 
yet I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love - - and I , Paul , do this as an old man , and now also as a prisoner of Christ Jesus . 
I am appealing to you for my child , Onesimus , whose father I have become during my imprisonment . 
Formerly he was useless to you , but now he is indeed useful both to you and to me . 
I am sending him , that is , my own heart , back to you . 
I wanted to keep him with me , so that he might be of service to me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel ; 
but I preferred to do nothing without your consent , in order that your good deed might be voluntary and not something forced . 
Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while , so that you might have him back forever , 
no longer as a slave but more than a slave , a beloved brother - - especially to me but how much more to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord . 
So if you consider me your partner , welcome him as you would welcome me . 
If he has wronged you in any way , or owes you anything , charge that to my account . 
I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand : I will repay it . I say nothing about your owing me even your own self . 
Yes , brother , let me have this benefit from you in the Lord ! Refresh my heart in Christ . 
Confident of your obedience , I am writing to you , knowing that you will do even more than I say . 
One thing more - - prepare a guest room for me , for I am hoping through your prayers to be restored to you . 
Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus , sends greetings to you , 
and so do Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers . 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . 
Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets , 
but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom he also created the worlds . 
He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact imprint of God's very being , and he sustains all things by his powerful word . When he had made purification for sins , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high , 
having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs . 
For to which of the angels did God ever say , " You are my Son ; today I have begotten you " ? Or again , " I will be his Father , and he will be my Son " ? 
And again , when he brings the firstborn into the world , he says , " Let all God's angels worship him . " 
Of the angels he says , " He makes his angels winds , and his servants flames of fire . " 
But of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever , and the righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom . 
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions . " 
And , " In the beginning , Lord , you founded the earth , and the heavens are the work of your hands ; 
they will perish , but you remain ; they will all wear out like clothing ; 
like a cloak you will roll them up , and like clothing they will be changed . But you are the same , and your years will never end . " 
But to which of the angels has he ever said , " Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet " ? 
Are not all angels spirits in the divine service , sent to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation ? 
Therefore we must pay greater attention to what we have heard , so that we do not drift away from it . 
For if the message declared through angels was valid , and every transgression or disobedience received a just penalty , 
how can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation ? It was declared at first through the Lord , and it was attested to us by those who heard him , 
while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , distributed according to his will . 
Now God did not subject the coming world , about which we are speaking , to angels . 
But someone has testified somewhere , " What are human beings that you are mindful of them , or mortals , that you care for them ? 
You have made them for a little while lower than the angels ; you have crowned them with glory and honor , 
subjecting all things under their feet . " Now in subjecting all things to them , God left nothing outside their control . As it is , we do not yet see everything in subjection to them , 
but we do see Jesus , who for a little while was made lower than the angels , now crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death , so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone . 
It was fitting that God , for whom and through whom all things exist , in bringing many children to glory , should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings . 
For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father . For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters , 
saying , " I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters , in the midst of the congregation I will praise you . " 
And again , " I will put my trust in him . " And again , " Here am I and the children whom God has given me . " 
Since , therefore , the children share flesh and blood , he himself likewise shared the same things , so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death , that is , the devil , 
and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death . 
For it is clear that he did not come to help angels , but the descendants of Abraham . 
Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in every respect , so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God , to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people . 
Because he himself was tested by what he suffered , he is able to help those who are being tested . 
Therefore , brothers and sisters , holy partners in a heavenly calling , consider that Jesus , the apostle and high priest of our confession , 
was faithful to the one who appointed him , just as Moses also " was faithful in all God's house . " 
Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses , just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself . 
( For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God . ) 
Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant , to testify to the things that would be spoken later . 
Christ , however , was faithful over God's house as a son , and we are his house if we hold firm the confidence and the pride that belong to hope . 
Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says , " Today , if you hear his voice , 
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , as on the day of testing in the wilderness , 
where your ancestors put me to the test , though they had seen my works
for forty years . Therefore I was angry with that generation , and I said , 'They always go astray in their hearts , and they have not known my ways . '
As in my anger I swore , 'They will not enter my rest . ' " 
Take care , brothers and sisters , that none of you may have an evil , unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God . 
But exhort one another every day , as long as it is called " today , " so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin . 
For we have become partners of Christ , if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end . 
As it is said , " Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion . " 
Now who were they who heard and yet were rebellious ? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses ? 
But with whom was he angry forty years ? Was it not those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ? 
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest , if not to those who were disobedient ? 
So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief . 
Therefore , while the promise of entering his rest is still open , let us take care that none of you should seem to have failed to reach it . 
For indeed the good news came to us just as to them ; but the message they heard did not benefit them , because they were not united by faith with those who listened . 
For we who have believed enter that rest , just as God has said , " As in my anger I swore , 'They shall not enter my rest , ' " though his works were finished at the foundation of the world . 
For in one place it speaks about the seventh day as follows , " And God rested on the seventh day from all his works . " 
And again in this place it says , " They shall not enter my rest . " 
Since therefore it remains open for some to enter it , and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience , 
again he sets a certain day - - " today " - - saying through David much later , in the words already quoted , " Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts . " 
For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not speak later about another day . 
So then , a sabbath rest still remains for the people of God ; 
for those who enter God's rest also cease from their labors as God did from his . 
Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest , so that no one may fall through such disobedience as theirs . 
Indeed , the word of God is living and active , sharper than any two - edged sword , piercing until it divides soul from spirit , joints from marrow ; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart . 
And before him no creature is hidden , but all are naked and laid bare to the eyes of the one to whom we must render an account . 
Since , then , we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast to our confession . 
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are , yet without sin . 
Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness , so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need . 
Every high priest chosen from among mortals is put in charge of things pertaining to God on their behalf , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins . 
He is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward , since he himself is subject to weakness ; 
and because of this he must offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people . 
And one does not presume to take this honor , but takes it only when called by God , just as Aaron was . 
So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest , but was appointed by the one who said to him , " You are my Son , today I have begotten you " ; 
as he says also in another place , " You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . " 
In the days of his flesh , Jesus offered up prayers and supplications , with loud cries and tears , to the one who was able to save him from death , and he was heard because of his reverent submission . 
Although he was a Son , he learned obedience through what he suffered ; 
and having been made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him , 
having been designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek . 
About this we have much to say that is hard to explain , since you have become dull in understanding . 
For though by this time you ought to be teachers , you need someone to teach you again the basic elements of the oracles of God . You need milk , not solid food ; 
for everyone who lives on milk , being still an infant , is unskilled in the word of righteousness . 
But solid food is for the mature , for those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish good from evil . 
Therefore let us go on toward perfection , leaving behind the basic teaching about Christ , and not laying again the foundation : repentance from dead works and faith toward God , 
instruction about baptisms , laying on of hands , resurrection of the dead , and eternal judgment . 
And we will do this , if God permits . 
For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened , and have tasted the heavenly gift , and have shared in the Holy Spirit , 
and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come , 
and then have fallen away , since on their own they are crucifying again the Son of God and are holding him up to contempt . 
Ground that drinks up the rain falling on it repeatedly , and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated , receives a blessing from God . 
But if it produces thorns and thistles , it is worthless and on the verge of being cursed ; its end is to be burned over . 
Even though we speak in this way , beloved , we are confident of better things in your case , things that belong to salvation . 
For God is not unjust ; he will not overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints , as you still do . 
And we want each one of you to show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope to the very end , 
so that you may not become sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises . 
When God made a promise to Abraham , because he had no one greater by whom to swear , he swore by himself , 
saying , " I will surely bless you and multiply you . " 
And thus Abraham , having patiently endured , obtained the promise . 
Human beings , of course , swear by someone greater than themselves , and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all dispute . 
In the same way , when God desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose , he guaranteed it by an oath , 
so that through two unchangeable things , in which it is impossible that God would prove false , we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to seize the hope set before us . 
We have this hope , a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul , a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain , 
where Jesus , a forerunner on our behalf , has entered , having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek . 
This " King Melchizedek of Salem , priest of the Most High God , met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him " ; 
and to him Abraham apportioned " one - tenth of everything . " His name , in the first place , means " king of righteousness " ; next he is also king of Salem , that is , " king of peace . " 
Without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but resembling the Son of God , he remains a priest forever . 
See how great he is ! Even Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of the spoils . 
And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to collect tithes from the people , that is , from their kindred , though these also are descended from Abraham . 
But this man , who does not belong to their ancestry , collected tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises . 
It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior . 
In the one case , tithes are received by those who are mortal ; in the other , by one of whom it is testified that he lives . 
One might even say that Levi himself , who receives tithes , paid tithes through Abraham , 
for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him . 
Now if perfection had been attainable through the levitical priesthood - - for the people received the law under this priesthood - - what further need would there have been to speak of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek , rather than one according to the order of Aaron ? 
For when there is a change in the priesthood , there is necessarily a change in the law as well . 
Now the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe , from which no one has ever served at the altar . 
For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah , and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests . 
It is even more obvious when another priest arises , resembling Melchizedek , 
one who has become a priest , not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent , but through the power of an indestructible life . 
For it is attested of him , " You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . " 
There is , on the one hand , the abrogation of an earlier commandment because it was weak and ineffectual
( for the law made nothing perfect ) ; there is , on the other hand , the introduction of a better hope , through which we approach God . 
This was confirmed with an oath ; for others who became priests took their office without an oath , 
but this one became a priest with an oath , because of the one who said to him , " The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind , 'You are a priest forever' " - - 
accordingly Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant . 
Furthermore , the former priests were many in number , because they were prevented by death from continuing in office ; 
but he holds his priesthood permanently , because he continues forever . 
Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him , since he always lives to make intercession for them . 
For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest , holy , blameless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and exalted above the heavens . 
Unlike the other high priests , he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day , first for his own sins , and then for those of the people ; this he did once for all when he offered himself . 
For the law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness , but the word of the oath , which came later than the law , appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever . 
Now the main point in what we are saying is this : we have such a high priest , one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens , 
a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent that the Lord , and not any mortal , has set up . 
For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices ; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer . 
Now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law . 
They offer worship in a sanctuary that is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly one ; for Moses , when he was about to erect the tent , was warned , " See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain . " 
But Jesus has now obtained a more excellent ministry , and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant , which has been enacted through better promises . 
For if that first covenant had been faultless , there would have been no need to look for a second one . 
God finds fault with them when he says : " The days are surely coming , says the Lord , when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ; 
not like the covenant that I made with their ancestors , on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; for they did not continue in my covenant , and so I had no concern for them , says the Lord . 
This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their minds , and write them on their hearts , and I will be their God , and they shall be my people . 
And they shall not teach one another or say to each other , 'Know the Lord , ' for they shall all know me , from the least of them to the greatest . 
For I will be merciful toward their iniquities , and I will remember their sins no more . " 
In speaking of " a new covenant , " he has made the first one obsolete . And what is obsolete and growing old will soon disappear . 
Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary . 
For a tent was constructed , the first one , in which were the lampstand , the table , and the bread of the Presence ; this is called the Holy Place . 
Behind the second curtain was a tent called the Holy of Holies . 
In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which there were a golden urn holding the manna , and Aaron's rod that budded , and the tablets of the covenant ; 
above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat . Of these things we cannot speak now in detail . 
Such preparations having been made , the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties ; 
but only the high priest goes into the second , and he but once a year , and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed unintentionally by the people . 
By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary has not yet been disclosed as long as the first tent is still standing . 
This is a symbol of the present time , during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper , 
but deal only with food and drink and various baptisms , regulations for the body imposed until the time comes to set things right . 
But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come , then through the greater and perfect tent ( not made with hands , that is , not of this creation ) , 
he entered once for all into the Holy Place , not with the blood of goats and calves , but with his own blood , thus obtaining eternal redemption . 
For if the blood of goats and bulls , with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer , sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified , 
how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God ! 
For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance , because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant . 
Where a will is involved , the death of the one who made it must be established . 
For a will takes effect only at death , since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive . 
Hence not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood . 
For when every commandment had been told to all the people by Moses in accordance with the law , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people , 
saying , " This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you . " 
And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship . 
Indeed , under the law almost everything is purified with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins . 
Thus it was necessary for the sketches of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites , but the heavenly things themselves need better sacrifices than these . 
For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands , a mere copy of the true one , but he entered into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf . 
Nor was it to offer himself again and again , as the high priest enters the Holy Place year after year with blood that is not his own ; 
for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world . But as it is , he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to remove sin by the sacrifice of himself . 
And just as it is appointed for mortals to die once , and after that the judgment , 
so Christ , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time , not to deal with sin , but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him . 
Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities , it can never , by the same sacrifices that are continually offered year after year , make perfect those who approach . 
Otherwise , would they not have ceased being offered , since the worshipers , cleansed once for all , would no longer have any consciousness of sin ? 
But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year . 
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins . 
Consequently , when Christ came into the world , he said , " Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired , but a body you have prepared for me ; 
in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure . 
Then I said , 'See , God , I have come to do your will , O God' ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) . " 
When he said above , " You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings " ( these are offered according to the law ) , 
then he added , " See , I have come to do your will . " He abolishes the first in order to establish the second . 
And it is by God's will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
