In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . 
He was in the beginning with God . 
All things came into being through him , and without him not one thing came into being . What has come into being
in him was life , and the life was the light of all people . 
The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness did not overcome it . 
There was a man sent from God , whose name was John . 
He came as a witness to testify to the light , so that all might believe through him . 
He himself was not the light , but he came to testify to the light . 
The true light , which enlightens everyone , was coming into the world . 
He was in the world , and the world came into being through him ; yet the world did not know him . 
He came to what was his own , and his own people did not accept him . 
But to all who received him , who believed in his name , he gave power to become children of God , 
who were born , not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man , but of God . 
And the Word became flesh and lived among us , and we have seen his glory , the glory as of a father's only son , full of grace and truth . 
( John testified to him and cried out , " This was he of whom I said , 'He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me . ' " ) 
From his fullness we have all received , grace upon grace . 
The law indeed was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ . 
No one has ever seen God . It is God the only Son , who is close to the Father's heart , who has made him known . 
This is the testimony given by John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , " Who are you ? " 
He confessed and did not deny it , but confessed , " I am not the Messiah . " 
And they asked him , " What then ? Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the prophet ? " He answered , " No . " 
Then they said to him , " Who are you ? Let us have an answer for those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? " 
He said , " I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness , 'Make straight the way of the Lord , ' " as the prophet Isaiah said . 
Now they had been sent from the Pharisees . 
They asked him , " Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah , nor Elijah , nor the prophet ? " 
John answered them , " I baptize with water . Among you stands one whom you do not know , 
the one who is coming after me ; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal . " 
This took place in Bethany across the Jordan where John was baptizing . 
The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared , " Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world ! 
This is he of whom I said , 'After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me . '
I myself did not know him ; but I came baptizing with water for this reason , that he might be revealed to Israel . " 
And John testified , " I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it remained on him . 
I myself did not know him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me , 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit . '
And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God . " 
The next day John again was standing with two of his disciples , 
and as he watched Jesus walk by , he exclaimed , " Look , here is the Lamb of God ! " 
The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Jesus . 
When Jesus turned and saw them following , he said to them , " What are you looking for ? " They said to him , " Rabbi " ( which translated means Teacher ) , " where are you staying ? " 
He said to them , " Come and see . " They came and saw where he was staying , and they remained with him that day . It was about four o'clock in the afternoon . 
One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew , Simon Peter's brother . 
He first found his brother Simon and said to him , " We have found the Messiah " ( which is translated Anointed ) . 
He brought Simon to Jesus , who looked at him and said , " You are Simon son of John . You are to be called Cephas " ( which is translated Peter ) . 
The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee . He found Philip and said to him , " Follow me . " 
Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter . 
Philip found Nathanael and said to him , " We have found him about whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote , Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth . " 
Nathanael said to him , " Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . " 
When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said of him , " Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit ! " 
Nathanael asked him , " Where did you get to know me ? " Jesus answered , " I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called you . " 
Nathanael replied , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! You are the King of Israel ! " 
Jesus answered , " Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than these . " 
And he said to him , " Very truly , I tell you , you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man . " 
On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there . 
Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding . 
When the wine gave out , the mother of Jesus said to him , " They have no wine . " 
And Jesus said to her , " Woman , what concern is that to you and to me ? My hour has not yet come . " 
His mother said to the servants , " Do whatever he tells you . " 
Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification , each holding twenty or thirty gallons . 
Jesus said to them , " Fill the jars with water . " And they filled them up to the brim . 
He said to them , " Now draw some out , and take it to the chief steward . " So they took it . 
When the steward tasted the water that had become wine , and did not know where it came from ( though the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the steward called the bridegroom
and said to him , " Everyone serves the good wine first , and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk . But you have kept the good wine until now . " 
Jesus did this , the first of his signs , in Cana of Galilee , and revealed his glory ; and his disciples believed in him . 
After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother , his brothers , and his disciples ; and they remained there a few days . 
The Passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . 
In the temple he found people selling cattle , sheep , and doves , and the money changers seated at their tables . 
Making a whip of cords , he drove all of them out of the temple , both the sheep and the cattle . He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables . 
He told those who were selling the doves , " Take these things out of here ! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace ! " 
His disciples remembered that it was written , " Zeal for your house will consume me . " 
The Jews then said to him , " What sign can you show us for doing this ? " 
Jesus answered them , " Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . " 
The Jews then said , " This temple has been under construction for forty - six years , and will you raise it up in three days ? " 
But he was speaking of the temple of his body . 
After he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this ; and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken . 
When he was in Jerusalem during the Passover festival , many believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing . 
But Jesus on his part would not entrust himself to them , because he knew all people
and needed no one to testify about anyone ; for he himself knew what was in everyone . 
Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus , a leader of the Jews . 
He came to Jesus by night and said to him , " Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God ; for no one can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God . " 
Jesus answered him , " Very truly , I tell you , no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above . " 
Nicodemus said to him , " How can anyone be born after having grown old ? Can one enter a second time into the mother's womb and be born ? " 
Jesus answered , " Very truly , I tell you , no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit . 
What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Spirit is spirit . 
Do not be astonished that I said to you , 'You must be born from above . ' 
The wind blows where it chooses , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit . " 
Nicodemus said to him , " How can these things be ? " 
Jesus answered him , " Are you a teacher of Israel , and yet you do not understand these things ? 
" Very truly , I tell you , we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen ; yet you do not receive our testimony . 
If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe , how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things ? 
No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven , the Son of Man . 
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , so must the Son of Man be lifted up , 
that whoever believes in him may have eternal life . 
" For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life . 
" Indeed , God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world , but in order that the world might be saved through him . 
Those who believe in him are not condemned ; but those who do not believe are condemned already , because they have not believed in the name of the only Son of God . 
And this is the judgment , that the light has come into the world , and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil . 
For all who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light , so that their deeds may not be exposed . 
But those who do what is true come to the light , so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done in God . " 
After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside , and he spent some time there with them and baptized . 
John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim because water was abundant there ; and people kept coming and were being baptized
- - John , of course , had not yet been thrown into prison . 
Now a discussion about purification arose between John's disciples and a Jew . 
They came to John and said to him , " Rabbi , the one who was with you across the Jordan , to whom you testified , here he is baptizing , and all are going to him . " 
John answered , " No one can receive anything except what has been given from heaven . 
You yourselves are my witnesses that I said , 'I am not the Messiah , but I have been sent ahead of him . ' 
He who has the bride is the bridegroom . The friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice . For this reason my joy has been fulfilled . 
He must increase , but I must decrease . " 
The one who comes from above is above all ; the one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things . The one who comes from heaven is above all . 
He testifies to what he has seen and heard , yet no one accepts his testimony . 
Whoever has accepted his testimony has certified this , that God is true . 
He whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for he gives the Spirit without measure . 
The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hands . 
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life ; whoever disobeys the Son will not see life , but must endure God's wrath . 
Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard , " Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John " 
- - although it was not Jesus himself but his disciples who baptized - - 
he left Judea and started back to Galilee . 
But he had to go through Samaria . 
So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar , near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph . 
Jacob's well was there , and Jesus , tired out by his journey , was sitting by the well . It was about noon . 
A Samaritan woman came to draw water , and Jesus said to her , " Give me a drink . " 
( His disciples had gone to the city to buy food . ) 
The Samaritan woman said to him , " How is it that you , a Jew , ask a drink of me , a woman of Samaria ? " ( Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans . ) 
Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God , and who it is that is saying to you , 'Give me a drink , ' you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . " 
The woman said to him , " Sir , you have no bucket , and the well is deep . Where do you get that living water ? 
Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob , who gave us the well , and with his sons and his flocks drank from it ? " 
Jesus said to her , " Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again , 
but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty . The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life . " 
The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water . " 
Jesus said to her , " Go , call your husband , and come back . " 
The woman answered him , " I have no husband . " Jesus said to her , " You are right in saying , 'I have no husband' ; 
for you have had five husbands , and the one you have now is not your husband . What you have said is true ! " 
The woman said to him , " Sir , I see that you are a prophet . 
Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem . " 
Jesus said to her , " Woman , believe me , the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem . 
You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we know , for salvation is from the Jews . 
But the hour is coming , and is now here , when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such as these to worship him . 
God is spirit , and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . " 
The woman said to him , " I know that Messiah is coming " ( who is called Christ ) . " When he comes , he will proclaim all things to us . " 
Jesus said to her , " I am he , the one who is speaking to you . " 
Just then his disciples came . They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman , but no one said , " What do you want ? " or , " Why are you speaking with her ? " 
Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city . She said to the people , 
" Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done ! He cannot be the Messiah , can he ? " 
They left the city and were on their way to him . 
Meanwhile the disciples were urging him , " Rabbi , eat something . " 
But he said to them , " I have food to eat that you do not know about . " 
So the disciples said to one another , " Surely no one has brought him something to eat ? " 
Jesus said to them , " My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work . 
Do you not say , 'Four months more , then comes the harvest' ? But I tell you , look around you , and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting . 
The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life , so that sower and reaper may rejoice together . 
For here the saying holds true , 'One sows and another reaps . '
I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor . Others have labored , and you have entered into their labor . " 
Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony , " He told me everything I have ever done . " 
So when the Samaritans came to him , they asked him to stay with them ; and he stayed there two days . 
And many more believed because of his word . 
They said to the woman , " It is no longer because of what you said that we believe , for we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world . " 
When the two days were over , he went from that place to Galilee
( for Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in the prophet's own country ) . 
When he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , since they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival ; for they too had gone to the festival . 
Then he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine . Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in Capernaum . 
When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went and begged him to come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death . 
Then Jesus said to him , " Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe . " 
The official said to him , " Sir , come down before my little boy dies . " 
Jesus said to him , " Go ; your son will live . " The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and started on his way . 
As he was going down , his slaves met him and told him that his child was alive . 
So he asked them the hour when he began to recover , and they said to him , " Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him . " 
The father realized that this was the hour when Jesus had said to him , " Your son will live . " So he himself believed , along with his whole household . 
Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee . In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . 
He was with God in the beginning . 
Through him all things were made ; without him nothing was made that has been made . 
In him was life , and that life was the light of all people . 
The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not overcome it . 
There was a man sent from God whose name was John . 
He came as a witness to testify concerning that light , so that through him all might believe . 
He himself was not the light ; he came only as a witness to the light . 
The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world . 
He was in the world , and though the world was made through him , the world did not recognize him . 
He came to that which was his own , but his own did not receive him . 
Yet to all who did receive him , to those who believed in his name , he gave the right to become children of God�
children born not of natural descent , nor of human decision or a husband's will , but born of God . 
The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us . We have seen his glory , the glory of the one and only Son , who came from the Father , full of grace and truth . 
( John testified concerning him . He cried out , saying , " This is he of whom I said , 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me . ' " ) 
Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given . 
For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ . 
No one has ever seen God , but the one and only Son , who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father , has made him known . 
Now this was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was . 
He did not fail to confess , but confessed freely , " I am not the Messiah . " 
They asked him , " Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? " He said , " I am not . " " Are you the Prophet ? " He answered , " No . " 
Finally they said , " Who are you ? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? " 
John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet , " I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness , 'Make straight the way for the Lord . ' " 
Now the Pharisees who had been sent
questioned him , " Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? " 
" I baptize with water , " John replied , " but among you stands one you do not know . 
He is the one who comes after me , the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie . " 
This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan , where John was baptizing . 
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said , " Look , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world ! 
This is the one I meant when I said , 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me . '
I myself did not know him , but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel . " 
Then John gave this testimony : " I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him . 
And I myself did not know him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me , 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit . '
I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One . " 
The next day John was there again with two of his disciples . 
When he saw Jesus passing by , he said , " Look , the Lamb of God ! " 
When the two disciples heard him say this , they followed Jesus . 
Turning around , Jesus saw them following and asked , " What do you want ? " They said , " Rabbi " ( which means " Teacher " ) , " where are you staying ? " 
" Come , " he replied , " and you will see . " So they went and saw where he was staying , and they spent that day with him . It was about four in the afternoon . 
Andrew , Simon Peter's brother , was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus . 
The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him , " We have found the Messiah " ( that is , the Christ ) . 
And he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , " You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas " ( which , when translated , is Peter ) . 
The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee . Finding Philip , he said to him , " Follow me . " 
Philip , like Andrew and Peter , was from the town of Bethsaida . 
Philip found Nathanael and told him , " We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law , and about whom the prophets also wrote�Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . " 
" Nazareth ! Can anything good come from there ? " Nathanael asked . " Come and see , " said Philip . 
When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching , he said of him , " Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit . " 
" How do you know me ? " Nathanael asked . Jesus answered , " I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you . " 
Then Nathanael declared , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ; you are the king of Israel . " 
Jesus said , " You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree . You will see greater things than that . " 
He then added , " Very truly I tell you , you will see 'heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending on' the Son of Man . " 
On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee . Jesus' mother was there , 
and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding . 
When the wine was gone , Jesus' mother said to him , " They have no more wine . " 
" Woman , why do you involve me ? " Jesus replied . " My hour has not yet come . " 
His mother said to the servants , " Do whatever he tells you . " 
Nearby stood six stone water jars , the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing , each holding from twenty to thirty gallons . 
Jesus said to the servants , " Fill the jars with water " ; so they filled them to the brim . 
Then he told them , " Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet . " They did so , 
and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine . He did not realize where it had come from , though the servants who had drawn the water knew . Then he called the bridegroom aside
and said , " Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink ; but you have saved the best till now . " 
What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory ; and his disciples put their faith in him . 
After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples . There they stayed for a few days . 
When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover , Jesus went up to Jerusalem . 
In the temple courts he found people selling cattle , sheep and doves , and others sitting at tables exchanging money . 
So he made a whip out of cords , and drove all from the temple courts , both sheep and cattle ; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables . 
To those who sold doves he said , " Get these out of here ! Stop turning my Father's house into a market ! " 
His disciples remembered that it is written : " Zeal for your house will consume me . " 
The Jews then responded to him , " What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this ? " 
Jesus answered them , " Destroy this temple , and I will raise it again in three days . " 
They replied , " It has taken forty - six years to build this temple , and you are going to raise it in three days ? " 
But the temple he had spoken of was his body . 
After he was raised from the dead , his disciples recalled what he had said . Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken . 
Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival , many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name . 
But Jesus would not entrust himself to them , for he knew all people . 
He did not need human testimony about them , for he knew what was in them . 
Now there was a Pharisee , a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council . 
He came to Jesus at night and said , " Rabbi , we know that you are a teacher who has come from God . For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him . " 
Jesus replied , " Very truly I tell you , no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again . " 
" How can anyone be born when they are old ? " Nicodemus asked . " Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born ! " 
Jesus answered , " Very truly I tell you , no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit . 
Flesh gives birth to flesh , but the Spirit gives birth to spirit . 
You should not be surprised at my saying , 'You must be born again . '
The wind blows wherever it pleases . You hear its sound , but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going . So it is with everyone born of the Spirit . " 
" How can this be ? " Nicodemus asked . 
" You are Israel's teacher , " said Jesus , " and do you not understand these things ? 
Very truly I tell you , we speak of what we know , and we testify to what we have seen , but still you people do not accept our testimony . 
I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe ; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things ? 
No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven�the Son of Man . 
Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness , so the Son of Man must be lifted up , 
that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him . " 
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . 
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world , but to save the world through him . 
Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son . 
This is the verdict : Light has come into the world , but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil . 
All those who do evil hate the light , and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed . 
But those who live by the truth come into the light , so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God . 
After this , Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside , where he spent some time with them , and baptized . 
Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because there was plenty of water , and people were coming and being baptized . 
( This was before John was put in prison . ) 
An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing . 
They came to John and said to him , " Rabbi , that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan�the one you testified about�look , he is baptizing , and everyone is going to him . " 
To this John replied , " A person can receive only what is given from heaven . 
You yourselves can testify that I said , 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him . '
The bride belongs to the bridegroom . The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him , and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice . That joy is mine , and it is now complete . 
He must become greater ; I must become less . " 
The one who comes from above is above all ; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks as one from the earth . The one who comes from heaven is above all . 
He testifies to what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony . 
The person who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful . 
For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God gives the Spirit without limit . 
The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands . 
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life , but whoever rejects the Son will not see life , for God's wrath remains on them . 
Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John�
although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized , but his disciples . 
So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee . 
Now he had to go through Samaria . 
So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar , near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph . 
Jacob's well was there , and Jesus , tired as he was from the journey , sat down by the well . It was about noon . 
When a Samaritan woman came to draw water , Jesus said to her , " Will you give me a drink ? " 
( His disciples had gone into the town to buy food . ) 
The Samaritan woman said to him , " You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman . How can you ask me for a drink ? " ( For Jews do not associate with Samaritans . ) 
Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink , you would have asked him and he would have given you living water . " 
" Sir , " the woman said , " you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep . Where can you get this living water ? 
Are you greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well and drank from it himself , as did also his sons and his flocks and herds ? " 
Jesus answered , " Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again , 
but those who drink the water I give them will never thirst . Indeed , the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life . " 
The woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water . " 
He told her , " Go , call your husband and come back . " 
" I have no husband , " she replied . Jesus said to her , " You are right when you say you have no husband . 
The fact is , you have had five husbands , and the man you now have is not your husband . What you have just said is quite true . " 
" Sir , " the woman said , " I can see that you are a prophet . 
Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem . " 
" Woman , " Jesus replied , " believe me , a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem . 
You Samaritans worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know , for salvation is from the Jews . 
Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth , for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks . 
God is spirit , and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth . " 
The woman said , " I know that Messiah " ( called Christ ) " is coming . When he comes , he will explain everything to us . " 
Then Jesus declared , " I , the one speaking to you�I am he . " 
Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman . But no one asked , " What do you want ? " or " Why are you talking with her ? " 
Then , leaving her water jar , the woman went back to the town and said to the people , 
" Come , see a man who told me everything I ever did . Could this be the Messiah ? " 
They came out of the town and made their way toward him . 
Meanwhile his disciples urged him , " Rabbi , eat something . " 
But he said to them , " I have food to eat that you know nothing about . " 
Then his disciples said to each other , " Could someone have brought him food ? " 
" My food , " said Jesus , " is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work . 
Don't you have a saying , 'It's still four months until harvest' ? I tell you , open your eyes and look at the fields ! They are ripe for harvest . 
Even now those who reap draw their wages , even now they harvest the crop for eternal life , so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together . 
Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true . 
I sent you to reap what you have not worked for . Others have done the hard work , and you have reaped the benefits of their labor . " 
Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony , " He told me everything I ever did . " 
So when the Samaritans came to him , they urged him to stay with them , and he stayed two days . 
And because of his words many more became believers . 
They said to the woman , " We no longer believe just because of what you said ; now we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world . " 
After the two days he left for Galilee . 
( Now Jesus himself had pointed out that prophets have no honor in their own country . ) 
When he arrived in Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him . They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival , for they also had been there . 
Once more he visited Cana in Galilee , where he had turned the water into wine . And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum . 
When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea , he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son , who was close to death . 
" Unless you people see signs and wonders , " Jesus told him , " you will never believe . " 
The royal official said , " Sir , come down before my child dies . " 
" Go , " Jesus replied , " your son will live . " The man took Jesus at his word and departed . 
While he was still on the way , his servants met him with the news that his boy was living . 
When he inquired as to the time when his son got better , they said to him , " Yesterday , at one in the afternoon , the fever left him . " 
Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him , " Your son will live . " So he and his whole household believed . 
This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee .
