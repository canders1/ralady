    A Definite Mystery

    PAMELA MUNRO
    UCLA




    Zapotec languages indicate tense, aspect, and modality with “aspect” prefixes on
    verbs. The most widely used of these prefixes mark Habitual, Perfective (or
    Completive), and Irrealis (or Potential), but a number of languages have addition-
    al, sometimes less well understood, aspect forms. In this paper I consider two
    similar Zapotec aspect markers, one indicating a definite future, the other (used
    only on motion verbs) with a quite different meaning. Are they one morpheme or
    two? It's a definite mystery—but my conclusion, based on both internal and
    comparative evidence, is that they are separate. 1

    1.      Introduction
    Tlacolula Valley Zapotec (TVZ; Ethnologue code ZAB) has been described as
    having seven aspects (Munro and Lopez, et al., 1999), illustrated in (1) for the
    verbs ‘runs’ and ‘puts on (a shirt)’.

    (1) Habitual:    rzh:ùu'nny ‘runs’                   ra'ahcw ‘puts on (a shirt)’
        Perfective: bzh:ùu'nny ‘ran’                     gwu'aht ‘put on (a shirt)’
        Progressive: cazh:ùu'nny ‘is running’            caya'ahcw ‘is putting on (a shirt)’
        Neutral:     —                                   naa'cw ‘is wearing (a shirt)’
        Irrealis:    yzh:ùu'nny ‘will run’               ga'acw ‘will put on (a shirt)’
        Subjunctive: nzh:ùu'nny ‘(if…)                   nya'ahcw ‘(if…)
                        had run’                             had put on (a shirt)’
        Definite:    x:ùu'nny ‘will surely run’          za'ahcw ‘will surely put on (a shirt)’

      The TVZ examples discussed here reflect the dialect of San Lucas Quiaviní (often called SLQZ):
    some were provided by my collaborator Felipe H. Lopez, who has graciously discussed all the
    issues I raise here; others come from a collection of texts about the immigration experience (Lopez
    and Munro, eds., in preparation). Great thanks also to Christopher Adam, Rosemary Beam de
    Azcona, Cheryl Black, John Foreman, Felicia Lee, Rosa María Rojas Torres, and Aaron Sonnen-
    schein, who provided helpful data and discussion, as well as to Michael Galant, Brook Lillehau-
    gen, Bernard Comrie, Alexandra Aikhenvald, and other members of the BLS audience and the
    UCLA American Indian Seminar for their helpful comments.

The examples show both that the shape of many (boldfaced) aspect prefixes varies
from verb to verb (conditioned both phonologically and lexically), and also that
some aspects don't occur for all verbs.
     The Definite proper, indicated by z- before vowels and s- (sometimes assimi-
lated, as with ‘will surely run’ in (1)) before consonants, is a ‘modal aspect’ (Lee
1999, 2006), used to specify futures that the speaker is certain will occur, as in (2)
and (3). (All z- verbs are boldfaced in this paper, with their translations under-
lined. TVZ is a VSO language; subjects are indicated by nouns or names or by
clitic pronouns.)

(2)      Z-eheh        Jwaany        Ba'ahc.   ‘Juan will surely go to Tlacolula.’ 2
         def-go        Juan          Tlacolula
(3)      S-tòo'oh      Gye'eihlly    ca'rr. ‘Mike will surely buy the car.’
         def-buy       Mike          car

Such examples contrast with Irrealis sentences like those in (4)-(5); the Irrealis
(which has many other modal uses) is a much more common way to show futures,
but speakers describe these as less certain.

(4)      Ch-iia Jwaany Ba'ahc.      ‘Juan will go to Tlacolula.’
         irr-go Juan     Tlacolula
(5)      Y-tòo'oh Gye'eihlly ca'rr. ‘Mike will buy the car.’
         irr-buy   Mike      car

    Another z- prefix occurs only with a small set of motion verbs (in TVZ, these
are rihah ‘goes’, rìe'd ‘comes’, and rihah ‘goes home’ 3 (paradigmatically distinct
from ‘goes’)) in examples like (6). For now, I will gloss this second z- prefix as
‘z2’, and will use that term to refer to such verbs for most of this paper.

(6)      Z-èe Jwaany             Ba'ahc.                ‘Juan was going to Tlacolula.’
         z2-go Juan              Tlacolula

Out of context, sentences like (6) typically have progressive translations; they
strongly suggest a reference to going or coming only one way, without complet-
ing the trip. This progressive sense seems to fill an important gap in the aspectual
paradigm shown in (1), since the three verbs of motion that can be used in with

  TVZ data is presented in the academic orthography of Munro and Lopez et al. (1999). Abbrevia-
tions used include an : animal, anap : anaphoric, and : andative, cop : copula, dct : deictic, def :
definite, dst : distal, emph : emphatic, form : formal, hab : habitual, inf : informal, irr : irrealis,
neut : neutral, opp.sex.sib : opposite sex sibling, perf : perfective, pl : plural, pron : pronoun base,
prf : perfective, prg : progressive, prx : proximate, pt : point (second position negative), rsp :
respectful, sbj : subjunctive, z2 : ‘non-future definite’; person and number are shown with 1, 2, 3,
s, p. Clitic boundaries are shown with =.

  This verb can also express directed motion into other enclosed areas.


                                                  92
                                         A Definite Mystery


the z2 prefix cannot be used with the Progressive ca- prefix.
     The z- prefixes in both (6) and (2) (as well as the s- in (3)) have been called
“Definite” (Lee 1999, 2006; Munro and Lopez, et al., 1999): Munro and Lopez et
al. (1999) and Lee (1999, 2006) call the z2 form in (6) the “non-future Definite”, 4
assuming it to reflect a separate but related use of the modal aspect prefix in (2).
(I will refer to Definite proper forms like those in (2)-(3) as “future Definites”
below to distinguish them from z2 forms.)
     In contrast, in Munro (2006) I asserted that there are two forms involved (with
the z2 form in (6) analyzed as non-modal); Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez (in
preparation), a textbook currently being used in first-year Zapotec classes native
speaker Felipe H. Lopez is teaching at UCSD, call z2 the “z-progressive”, follow-
ing the Lopez's intuitions about sentences like (6), in contrast with the Definite in
(2)-(3).
     Only motion verbs exhibit both future Definite and z2 forms; all other verbs
only have the future Definite. However, in most Zapotec languages forms of ‘go’
and ‘come’ can be incorporated at the front of a verb stem, following the aspect
prefix, forming “andative” and “venitive” verb forms, which can also appear with
both types of z- prefixes. All other derivatives of ‘go’ and ‘come’, such as
‘bring’/’take’ verbs, also have both forms. (I won't discuss these derived forms in
this paper.)

2.      Lee's Analysis
Lee (2006) writes that the Definite “can express either emphatic future readings
[as in (2)] or incomplete events in the immediate past [as in (6)]” (201); “while
past events expressed with Perfective verbs are understood as being fully com-
pleted at UT [utterance time], those expressed with Definite verbs are interpreted
as being initiated, but not yet fully culminated” (260). Her sophisticated analysis
of the syntax of these verbs considers their behavior both as matrix verbs and
when embedded under verbs of saying; she argues that both represent the same
aspect, with a modal meaning of necessity, thus suggesting an insightful way to
reconcile the seemingly disparate meanings of the z- verbs in (2)-(3) and (6).

       ... Definite-marked verbs (on both their future and non-future readings) describe events
       that haven't been completed yet, but are strongly believed by speakers to be inevitable: in
       the future Definite case, the event described has not begun yet, but the speaker emphati-
       cally believes it will occur; in the non-future case, the event is believed by the speaker to
       have been initiated, but not yet completed (and the eventual completion of the event is
       assumed). (p. 263)
            ...the future and non-future Definite are, despite their differences in temporal inter-
       pretation, manifestations of the same aspect and not merely different aspects that acciden-
       tally resemble each other. (p. 266)

3.   The Problem
However, z2 forms have a considerably wider range of uses than is illustrated in
4
    Alas, Munro and Lopez et al. (1999) also somewhat inconsistently use the term ‘realis Definite’.


                                                   93
                                  Pamela Munro


(6), especially in texts. First, Munro and Lopez et al. (1999) cite z2 forms that
express punctual rather than progressive events, such as (7):

(7)    Chih b-raguèe'll=ih,             z-eèe'=ëng     No'rt.
       when perf-be.next.day=3s.dst z2-go=3s.prx North
       ‘When the next day came (i.e., when it was the next day),
       he went to the United States.’

This does not seem like an incomplete event in the immediate past (as (6) might
be); the speaker is describing events that occurred years ago.
    (7) is taken from a 200-page collection of TVZ narratives about the immigra-
tion experience (Lopez and Munro, eds., in preparation) that provides many
examples of z2 verbs, as well as some future Definites of motion verbs, such as
(8), where the ‘surely’ sense of the Definite is contrasted with the less certain
Irrealis, or (9)-(10), which are additional punctual past examples.

(8)    Lla'az=a'        dàa'ru'      g-ya'=a',          sye'mmr z-ya'=a',

       'I thought that some day I would go home, I would surely go home for

       went off to; that person just left.’

       then neut.say supervisor             of=1s       what for        already
            z-e'=ùu'?’      nnà=ih,             chiru' r-e'ipy=a'       la'a=i

            zi'cy g-uhc         nìih z-a'=a'.
            thus perf-be        that        z2-go=1s
       ‘Then my supervisor said, “Why did you go?” he said, so I told him how it
       was that I left.’

As (9)-(10) show, z2 ‘go’ sentences without a directional object are often trans-
lated with ‘leave’.
    Z2 verbs may also express ofther aspectual notions. For example, my collabo-


                                         94
                                A Definite Mystery


rator Felipe Lopez feels that the Perfective and z2 verbs in (11)a-b could replace
each other. Perfective b-ìe'd in (a) could be z2 z-i'ìe'd, and z2 z-i'ìe'd=ëng in (b)
could be Perfective b-ìe'd=ëng:

(11)   a. — Xi     iihahz b-ìe'd      Cho'nn re'nn nah?...
            what year prf-come Chona here now
            ‘What year did Chona come here, now?’
       b. — Loh sete'nntayseiz z-i'ìe'd=ëng.
            in     seventy.six   z2-come=3s.prx
            ‘She came in seventy-six.’

Similarly, the z2 verb in (12), in which a narrator discusses the behavior of young
immigrants returning to Oaxaca, could be replaced by a Habitual verb:

(12)   Chih z-i'ìe'd=rih         laad rèe'       àa'?      A
       when z2-come=3p.dst side here what.about            already
           b-chùu=rih            ba'i.
           prf-change=3p.dst     well
       ‘And when they come back here? They've really changed.’
       (z-i'ìe'd=rih could be Habitual r-ìe'd=rih)

    The narratives also contain z2 forms whose meaning seems clearly progres-
sive (describing ongoing motion), much like the elicited example (6):

(13)   R-e'ipy=a'      làa'=rih       nehz.ahg.zahgu=ih a               z-a'=a'.
       hab-tell=1s     pron=3p.dst way.just=that             already    z2-go=1s
            ‘Tòo',’    nnah=rih,         ‘tye'nn     g-uuny=ùu' compa'anny’ —
            let's.go   neut.say=3p.dst so.that       irr-do=2s.inf company
            zi'cy nih r-chàag=za'        ra mnìi'ny sa'=nìi'.
            thus rel hab-meet=wow pl kid                 fellow=anap
       ‘I told them I was going that way. “Let's go,” they said, “then you can
       keep [us] company”— the way kids get together with each other.’

Of course, cross-linguistically progressives of motion verbs often develop into
future expressions, which may explain why (14) below seems to have a somewhat
less ongoing, more future reference. In fact, other z2 verbs sometimes express
unaccomplished notions that are more clearly neither present nor past, as in (15),
whose z2 form. Lopez feels, could be replaced by an Irrealis verb (though not by
a future Definite).

Crucially, it seems, non-actual z2 verbs like these either convey the idea of


                                          96
                                     A Definite Mystery


progressive ideas in the future, as in the second z2 form in (18) (and possibly also
(14)), or refer to possibility rather than necessity (as in (16) and (17)).

4.      Comparative Data
A number of other Zapotec languages appear to have cognates of both types of
TVZ z- forms; I will note here only data from two closely related Valley Zapotec
languages, 5 and from one quite distantly related language. 6
    Adam (2003:69; glosses adapted) writes that in Santo Domingo Albarradas
Zapotec (Dihidzx Bilyáhab) “The definite 7 is used in any tense to convey a
pending action or event”, but also “Another one of the definite's uses is to show
incompletion of an act of ‘going’ which has already begun as opposed to the
perfective which shows completion of the act of ‘going’ with a ‘return’” (70).
However, the same aspect prefix is also used in apparently punctual textual
examples like

(19)    Z-é=b         zhan nejez=gin g-ijti=b.
        def-go=an     butt road=dct perf-die=an
        ‘He fell down below that road and died.’ (Adam 2003:249 and p.c. 2007)

Adam (p.c.) has confirmed to me that these two “definite” forms are at least
sometimes morphologically distinct, with the cognate of the future Definite form
in (20)a and that of the z2 verb in (20)b:

(20)    a. future Definite z-ej|e|=zh          in z-ej|e|=zh yá ‘will he go?’
        b. z2 z-ée=zh                          in má z-ée=zh yá?
                                                  ‘did he already start going?’

As in TVZ, the future Definite may be used with (virtually) any verb, while the z2
form is restricted to a small class of motion verbs.
   López Cruz (1997; glosses adapted) analyzes the San Pablo Güilá Zapotec
cognate of the future Definite in (21)a as the “futuro” and the cognate of the z2
verb in (21)b as an allomorph of the “progresivo”:

(21)    a. s-yéed    Jwâany là'¢
           def-come Juan        field
           ‘Juan vendrá al campo [Juan will come to the field].’ (p. 90)



5
  I cannot discuss here data from another closely related Valley language, Santa Ana del Valle
Zapotec, kindly provided by Rosa María Rojas Torres, which seems in line with the Adam and
López Cruz data summarized below.
6
  There are also apparently two distinct z- forms in the Colonial Valley Zapotec descriptions by
Córdova (1578a, 1578b).
7
  Adam now refers to this form as “Alethic”, p.c. 2007.


                                              97
                                      Pamela Munro


        b. s-yeed     Jwâany là'¢
           z2-come Juan          field
           ‘Juan viene al campo [Juan comes/is coming to the field].’ (p. 89)

As (21) shows, these forms are morphologically distinct:. López Cruz's data also
shows that “progresivo” forms of motion verbs can have a punctual sense (again
often suggesting one-way motion), 8 as in

(22)    s-êe Jwâany là'¢
        z2-go Juan         field
        ‘Juan se fue al campo (no ha regresado)
        [Juan went to the field (he has not returned)].’ (pp. 91-92)

   Finally, Black (2004) identifies two separate cognate aspects in Quiegolani
Zapotec (a much more distantly related language of the Southern branch of
Zapotecan), a special z- prefix “used to express progressive action” with verbs of
motion (2004:27), such as those in ((23)) (p.c. 2007), and an s- Future prefix that
can be used with a wider range of verbs (2004:19), again including the motion
verbs, as in ((24)) (p.c. 2007):

(23)    z-a (progressive, ‘go away from base’ [cf. TVZ ‘go’])
        z-ya (progressive, ‘go to base’ [cf. TVZ ‘go home’])
(24)    s-a (Future, ‘go away from base’)
        s-ya (Future, ‘go to base’)

5.       Are There Two z- Aspects, or One?
5.1.
The z2 usage only occurs with a few verbs of motion and their derivatives, while
the future Definite occurs with (almost) every verb. The comparative data,
particularly from languages as distantly related as Quiegolani, supports the idea
that this situation is quite archaic.
     If the z2 usage is just another manifestation of the same aspect as the future
Definite, why should this very different z2 usage occur only with a small and
semantically restricted group of verbs, in so many languages? There seems to be
no explanation of why the very different z2 usage — even if related — should be
restricted to a small group of motion verbs. 9

5.2.
While the future Definite is a “modal” aspect, used to refer only to non-actual
events, most z2 uses refer to actual events in the present or past and thus do not
8
  López Cruz (1997:91-92) also mentions two additional forms of ‘ir’ which she suggests may be
additional aspects; these look like forms of TVZ ‘goes home’.
9
  Bernard Comrie and Alexandra Aikhenvald reminded me during the discussion at BLS of special
aspectual uses of motion verbs. So maybe this is not as unexpected as all that.


                                             98
                                      A Definite Mystery


seem “modal”. While there may be a connection between non-actuality and
incompleteness, many z2 usages with non-future reference do not describe
incomplete events. There doesn't seem to be anything incomplete about the z2
examples like (7), (9)-(10), or the first z2 form in (18), or several others here.
These don't seem to fit Lee's notion of “initiated but not fully culminated”.
However, they might be amenable to a different sense of “incompletive” like that
described for the Mayan language Mam by England (2007), since punctual z2
forms generally occur in texts, where they serve to advance a narrative that (when
the forms are used) is not yet complete. The lack of completion, then, is metalin-
guistic, and does not refer to the real-world status of the referenced event.
    As we've seen above, z2 forms can be also used to refer to clearly “non-
actual” events, as with (15)-(17), the second z2 form in (18), and perhaps also
(14). As Lee (1999, 2006) makes clear and I discuss in Munro (2006), there is not
a precise overlap between “modal aspect” and modal or non-actual reference. For
example, the “non-modal” Perfective aspect is used for imperatives and can also
refer to non-actual events to be completed in the future, as in

(25)     Yzh:ii     chih y-zëhnny=a', al            b-da'uh Gye'eihlly.
         tomorrow when irr-arrive=1s already        perf-eat Mike
         ‘When I arrive tomorrow, Mike will have already eaten.’
         (Lee 2006:13, ex. 36)

But the contrast between the future Definite and the full range of both modal and
non-modal uses of the z2 forms seems striking.

5.3.
Almost all z2 forms are pronounced slightly differently from corresponding
Definite proper forms, as shown by a comparison of (2) vs. (6), or the paradigms
in Table 1 on the next page. 10 However, the first person forms, both singular and
plural, are the same for both the future Definite and z2 in each case. As other
Zapotec specialists know, first person forms tend to be irregular in a variety of
ways (note that the first person stems of all three verbs are quite aberrant in these
and all other aspects; those of ‘comes’, in particular, are fully suppletive).
     Although it might be clearer that there were two separate aspects if all the
forms were distinguished, Zapotec tolerates a high degree of homophony and near
homophony (for example, many verbs that are distinguished in the Habitual are
neutralized in the Perfective; conversely, ‘goes’ and ‘goes home’ are identical in
the Habitual but differentiated in every other aspect). There would be no explana-
tion for the differences shown in Table 1 if the future Definite and z2 forms were
the same aspect.
10
   TVZ distinguishes six third persons (proximate, distal, respectful, animal, familiar, and
reverential; cf. Munro 2002). Second person formal forms and third person plural forms, whcih
tend to be more regular, are not shown in the table, but all of them distinguish the future Definite
and z2 forms.

5.4.
The z2 verb lacks certain structural peculiarities of the future Definite.
     First, sentences with z2 verbs may be negated (26), while, as Lee (2006:261)
notes, future Definite verbs ‘are dispreferred in clausal negation constructions’ :

(26)     Que'ity     z-èe=dy=ëng        Jwaany ri'cy nài'.
         neg         z2-go=pt=3s.prx Juan          there yesterday
         ‘Juan didn't go there yesterday.’
(27)     *Que'ity z-eheh=di'        Jwaany ricy zhii.
         neg         def-go=pt      Juan       there tomorrow
         ‘Juan will definitely not go there tomorrow.’

    Second, as Lee (2006:261-62) reports, the z2 form allows standard focus
fronting 11 (28), while the future Definite does not (29):




11
    Instead of future Definite sentences like (29)a, my collaborator Felipe Lopez prefers topic
constructions like (i) or the variant focus construction in (ii). Like a topic structure, but unlike a
standard focus sentence, the variant focus construction (ii) has a noticeable pause following the
initial constituent; unlike the topic structure, however, there is no resumptive element following
the verb. Lopez feels that the (ii) construction is strongly contrastive.

(i) Jwaany, z-eheh Jwaany Ba'ahc. ‘Juan, he will surely go to Tlacolula’
     Juan    def-go Juan     Tlacolula
(ii) Jwaany...   z-eheh Ba'ahc. ‘JUAN...will surely go to Tlacolula’
     Juan        def-go Tlacolula

                                A Definite Mystery


(28)   a. Jwaany      z-èe     Ba'ahc.     ‘JUAN was going to Tlacolula.’
          Juan        z2-go    Tlacolula       (cf. (6))
       b. Ba'ahc      z-èe     Jwaany.     ‘Juan was going to TLACOLULA.’
          Tlacolula   z2-go    Juan
(29)   a. *Jwaany     z-eheh   Ba'ahc.     ‘JUAN will surely go to Tlacolula.’
          Juan        def-go   Tlacolula       (cf. (2))
       b. *Ba'ahc     z-eheh   Jwaany.     ‘Juan will surely go to TLACOLULA.’
          Tlacolula   def-go   Juan

Lee proposes a plausible structural explanation for these differences, but it’s not
clear that it requires that the two verb forms in question be the same.

5.5.
Thus, there seem to be good reasons to distinguish the future Definite from the z2
form, which is only used with three verbs of motion and which has a much wider
range of both temporal and modal interpretations than the Definite. Certainly the
semantics of the z2 form are complex, and worthy of further study: while it often
overlaps with other aspects, speakers use it for particular effect, especially in
narrative.
     The question of what to call the z2 form remains. “Progressive” no longer
seems appropriate, at least for TVZ (more comparative work is needed to discover
whether languages like Quiegolani and SPGZ have a similar range of uses for
their cognate forms, and thus what the use of the ancestor of all these forms might
have been). A term like “Incomplete Motion” might seem appropriate for the
TVZ form, but is a bit unweildy for us to use in our textbook (Munro, Lillehau-
gen, and Lopez in preparation). We've decided, therefore, to call this form the
Incompletive, a name that pays tribute to Lee's analysis (though we reject the
notion that this form is just another use of the Definite) — but a name which can
only be understood through an insight like that England proposed concerning
aspect in Mam.
