                                     I dedicate this dissertation to my parents, Stanley P. Galant and Ilona
                             Galant, who have always inspired me to do my best in life and whose love and
                             support enabled me to get my education, to my brothers Daniel Morris Galant and
                            Jeffrey Galant, who have guided me through many challenges in my life and helped
                            me overcome many obstacles, to my grandmothers Sonia Galant and Miriam
                             Lichtenstein, for their unwavering love and involvement in my life, and to my
                            beloved grandfathers, Chaim Galant and Meier Lichtenstein, who I wish could have
                             been here to see the fruits of their inspiration realized.

                                     This dissertation would not have been possible without the help of the
                             University of California, numerous professors, colleagues, friends, and family.
                                     I would like to start off by thanking the UCLA Graduate Division for
                             awarding me with a Dissertation Year Fellowship, which enabled me to complete
                             my dissertation sooner than I could have otherwise. I am very glad that I had the
                            chance to study at UCLA.
                                     I would also like to thank Kerry Allen for constantly helping me with all
                             sorts of administrative matters in person, over the phone, and via e-mail. Her help
                             is greatly appreciated and has been essential to the completion of this project
                                     I am grateful to the French Department and the Department of Spanish and
                            Portuguese for providing me with several years of financial support in the form of
                            TAships, which both provided training for the future and made it possible to fund
                             my graduate studies.
                                     I would like to express my tremendous gratitude to the members of my
                            doctoral committee. Professor Jean-Claude Carron gladly agreed to join my
                             committee in order for three departments to be represented —I am glad that he
                             listened eagerly during my oral examinations and gave helpful feedback regarding
                            French, and his willingness to hire me as a teaching assistant for three years when
                            I entered the program cannot be forgotten, either, since that helped me greatly in
                             beginning my graduate career. Professor Susan Plann was always willing to hear
                             my ideas over lunch about my studies and my future career, and her Spanish
                             linguistics courses were a great inspiration to me. Professor A. Carlos Qufcoli has
                             provided me with many thoughtful discussions about Spanish and Portuguese
                             linguistics, and it was in fact through his encouragement that I entered the program
                             in Romance Linguistics and Literature in the first place. The biggest thanks I
                             gladly give to Professors Dominique Sportiche and Pamela Munro.

                                    Dominique Sportiche has taught me how to critically approach linguistic
                            analysis, and his ability to thoughtfully address any one of an enormous range of
                            topics on the spur of the moment, making even very complicated issues seem
                            simpler, has always amazed me - he has been a great role model for how a linguist
                            should be. He has spent countless hours discussing some of the most difficult
                            theoretical problems of my dissertation with me, often on short notice, and his
                            efforts have been greatly appreciated.
                                    Professor Pamela Munro has provided me with more support and guidance
                            than most inside committee members would. Always ready to e-mail me or fedex
                            something from LA or Oklahoma to Newport Beach or Texas, always ready to
                            answer my frantic phone calls, always organized to the hilt, I do not know how I
                            could have done this without her. She gave me pep talks when things were
                            difficult, and she got me data when I was desperate. She always took the time to
                            ask how everything else was going in my life, including my transition to life in
                            Texas. I will never forget her efforts and kindness. I hold her painstaking work in
                            great admiration, and I hope to be able to continue learning with her. She is a role
                            model for me.
                                    Professor Edward Keenan is also due thanks for his thoughtful discussions
                            on degree expressions vis-^-vis the adjectival and nominal systems. Both during
                            those talks and during the course in mathematical linguistics that I took with him, I
                            have seen that he is able to quickly translate into technical terms just about any
                            linguistic expression that he comes across. I have learned a lot from him.
                                    I also appreciate the other professors at UCLA in the Linguistics Dept, or
                            the Dept of Spanish and Portuguese with whom I have taken courses: Professor
                            Anoop Mahajan, Professor Timothy Stowell, Professor Donca Steriade, Professor
                            Anna Szabolcsi, Professor Thomas Hinnebusch, and Professor Carlos Otero.
                                    In addition, I am grateful to Professor Nicole Dufresne, Professor

                            Kimberly Jansma, Professor Susan Schaffer, and Professor Silvia Pellarolo for
                            having given me their trust to let me teach French and Spanish and for having
                            given me their guidance to learn the trade well. Teaching French and Spanish was
                            not only a way to get financial help and job training but also provoked many
                            questions regarding linguistics in my mind. My teaching experience at UCLA was
                            very positive.
                                     A special thanks is due to Professor Nancy Ezer not only for her wonderful
                            courses in Hebrew but also for her encouragement towards going as far as possible
                            in graduate school (she always knew that I would go for the PhD, even before I
                            knew it) and for her enormous contribution in the form of Hebrew data, which
                            although I wasn’t able to use directly in my dissertation, enabled me to see
                            paradigms in English, Spanish, and SLQZ more clearly. She is a good friend.
                                     Another positive element of my UCLA experience was the opportunity to
                            internet with kind, intelligent colleagues.
                                     I thank Felipe Lopez for taking me into his confidence and asking me to
                            study his language in the first place. He is an inspiration to anyone who wants to
                            get ahead in life, to get an education no matter what your original circumstances
                            are. He is very supportive of my studies and a good friend. My life will never be
                            the same as it was before SLQZ
                                     I am tremendously indebted and grateful to Rodrigo Garcia, my primary
                            consultant for SLQZ. He is the ideal consultant - intelligent, friendly,
                            accom m odating.    I am very fortunate that he shares his language with me. It is
                            because of the wonderful sentences that I was eliciting from him at one point that I
                            got the idea to work on comparatives in my dissertation. We have developed a
                            great friendship and comraderie.
                                     I would also like to thank the UCLA Linguistics Department for funding
                            endless hours of consultation with Rodrigo Garcia. The Linguistics Department

                            has always been very supportive of my endeavors.
                                     I thank Luiz Mendez for showing me very early on, by his own actions,
                            that someone can be good at linguistics but remain humble and help others. He is
                            one of the people who really got me going way back when I started graduate
                            school, and his ever-willingness to lend a kind word is appreciated.
                                     Manuel Espanol-Echeverria sometimes took two or three hours on the spur
                            of the moment to sit and discuss my dissertation with me. In addition to providing
                            me with data, he provided me with great ideas and moral support. He also steered
                            me in the direction of many useful sources for my research. I am grateful for his
                            help.
                                     Ivana Lyon is both an intelligent linguist and a kind person. She always
                            lent moral support in both teaching and linguistics when I needed it. I am also very
                            glad that she provided me with wonderful data in Serbo-Croatian which helped me
                            make decisions about the languages studied here and which will surely appear in
                            some article at some point
                                    Jos6 Luis Mirabal Rivera has been a special friend and colleague. He has
                            on many occasions shared teaching materials and Spanish data with me and has
                            always listened to me when it came to my dissertation. He is kind and hard­
                            working, and I am fortunate to have him in my life.
                                     Luis Silva-Villar is a true renaissance man. Like myself, he started in the
                            physical sciences and ended up in linguistics. He has been a great inspiration to
                            me not only because of his own accomplishments but also because of his continual
                            faith in me as a linguist with great potential. Not only does he have some of the
                            most interesting data in Spanish that I have ever seen, but he also is really sharp
                            and up-to-date on the latest material in linguistics. He has on many occasions been
                            a great mentor to me. He knows at least something about everything. [Is there
                            more than one scopal reading here ?] I am honored to have his friendship.




                                                                          xii

                                    Bill Leonard is the type of colleague that anyone in the world would hope to
                            have. Not only is he bright, informed, organized, and dynamic, he is one of the
                            best friends that I have ever had. His constant dedication as a friend, colleague,
                            and soulmate is the only way I have been able to make it through graduate school
                            and this dissertation. His humor and creative insight into all sorts of things that
                            interest me is unique and irreplaceable.
                                    Luciana Castro-Galvin is an unbelievably wonderful colleague and friend.
                            She has always supported me 110% when it comes to teaching, my dissertation, or
                            real life. In addition to her contributions of Portuguese data (which I will publish
                            somewhere at some point!), her constant faith in me and moral support have given
                            me the strength to continue and finish this project. I know that with her input, any
                            project that I face will be that much more successful.
                                    Ame Jaaska has been my in-person rock of support on more occasions than
                            anyone else. He knows what it’s like to work on a dissertation since he is working
                            on one, too. Whenever I felt that things just weren’t going to work out, he always
                            said the right thing to make things seem ok again. His company through the
                            sometimes lonely journey will never be forgotten. I cherish our friendship deeply.
                                    I have had support from colleagues in Texas, too. Elisa Garza has always
                            made it a point to make my remaining work seem doable and reassure me that I
                            would indeed finish my dissertation. Alejandro Cortazar has lent a sympathetic ear
                            on many an occasion and his own work ethic has been a motivation to work hard
                            myself. Marta Glueck has been a wonderful colleague, friend, and student She
                            has been supportive about my dissertation and has made sure that I kept working
                            on it. Rob Hale, Erika Solberg, Savas Papadopoulos, and Mohammed Faruqi
                            have also been part of the sympathy gang. David Sabrio, my chair, has always
                            been very patient about my finishing, and I appreciate that. Jaqueline Thomas
                            offered on more than one occasion to look over my ideas, and that means a lot to




                                                                         xiii

                                    I even have international thanks:
                                    I thank Luis Sdez for sending me many, many articles of his as soon as he
                            knew that I was working on comparatives. His articles have inspired much of this
                            present work. (And thanks to Marfa Uribe-Echevarrfa for letting me know about
                            his work in the first place !)
                                    Similarly, I thank Paulien Rijkhoek for sharing her manuscripts and ideas
                            with me. She has been extremely helpful both by our discussions and by the ideas
                            contained in her manuscripts.
                                    I would also like to thank Caterina Donati for sharing her manuscripts and
                            ideas with me.
                                    I also owe thanks to Norbert Corver for sending me manuscripts/handouts
                            of his and responding to e-mail questions that I had about comparatives.
                                    I thank all of the people who gave me data for my dissertation, and even
                            though I mostly restricted the data to English, Spanish, and SLQZ, the other data
                            helped me analyze the data that I did include and solidify or disconfirm various
                            theories that I had. I hope to be able to incorporate the data that I have not used yet
                            into future works. [The people who especially went way out of their way to
                            answer many of my e-mail surveys or to give me lots and lots of data or articles are
                            indicated by an asterisk - this does not mean that they are ungrammatical people.]

                            Miriam’s faith in me have been a large part of the formula to getting through this

                            during this time hasn’t been any less than in any other stage in my studies. I have
                            been fortunate to have his willing ear for many years now.
                                    Andrew Gorenbein is another good friend that could sympathize with my
                            work and who has always taken the time to see how I’m doing in Texas.
                                    Jim Babl has been a great sounding board and mentor - he was crucial in
                            making it through all the obstacles.
                                    Amoldo Armas always has a positive perspective on things, and he has
                            always been more than happy to spread his positive perspective to me and others.
                            His faith in me helped a great deal.
                                    Victor Silvas, Jr. has known me through a great part of this dissertation-
                            writing and has shown me his support not only over the phone to California from
                            Texas but also in Texas once I moved there. He was my only friend when I arrived
                            in Texas.
                                    My ex-student Josd Flores and his fiancee Estela Martfnez have also helped
                            me make the transition to Texas life and have been very sympathetic about my
                            dissertation.
                                    Robert Crook has a calmness and balance about life that make everything
                            seem okay. His support and friendship have always meant a lot to me.
                                    Esati Andrade has always reassured me that it’ll all work out. So has
                            Enrique Ortiz Rojas, Rafael Hernandez, Leonard Sanchez, Alejandro Toj,
                            Francisco Treto Banuelos, Antonio Treto Banuelos, Marcos A. Valencia, Jorge
                            Magarino, George Sanchez, and Sadi Martinez.
                                    Jos6 Eduardo Calis (who inspired the Chepo sentences) saw me through
                            the especially difficult last days in California last year and has always known that I
                            would finish.
                                    David Martfnez has been wonderful about staying in touch with me in
                            Texas. He always has something positive to say and is a good friend.

                                     David Jordan remembers me no matter which comer of the country or the
                            globe he happens to be in. His great faith in me has helped immeasurably.
                                     J. Abraham Huamdn has undergone great personal sacrifice himself to be a
                            doctor in this country and has helped me get through my dissertation both by his
                            own example of hard work and by his words of support.
                                     Josd Luis Medina Flores has kept in touch with me in Texas and offered
                            constant support that will never be forgotten. He always has kind words of
                            encouragement to offer.
                                     Francisco Mdrquez has expressed appreciation of my efforts to strive for
                            success in academia and has maintained our friendship across the distance.
                                     Eduardo Dfaz has been a pleasant voice to listen to off in far-away
                            California since I’ve been in Texas. His caring and encouragement has made the
                            journey less difficult.
                                     Allan Daniels and Ron and Debra Broide, my fellow California expatriots
                            living in Texas, have sympathized with the transition of life in a new state and have
                            been good friends for a long time. I especially appreciate their support when I
                            visited them in Houston.
                                     The Temple Sharon gang has always given me kind words of
                            encouragement: the Kaplans, the Millers, the Goelmans and Batstones, the Batis,
                            the Shanes, the Millers, the Gabais, and the Gyuriks.
                                     I am truly fortunate to have the family that I have:
                                     My mom and dad have always been there for me since day one. They
                            started inspiring me to get an education when I was still a toddler by giving me
                            great books. With a love for Yiddish and French, and by exposing me to Hebrew
                            through our religion, they helped me gain a fascination for language very early on.
                            My parents have always emphasized the importance of education, and they have
                            always backed me up on my choice of studies, even when I changed from

                            college career, including the final stretch, have meant the world to me. Thank you
                            Mom and Dad for all your love.
                                    My brothers Jeff and Dan have been super throughout my dissertation
                            writing process. They have been nothing but encouraging. I am very lucky to
                            have them around.
                                    My grandparents all immigrated to the United States from Europe, three of
                            the four being from Eastern Europe. Their multilingual background, love of
                            education, and emotional support both while I was writing my dissertation and in
                            general have been very inspiring to me. I love them very much.
                                    My Auntie Ev has always taken it upon her herself, being the loving and
                            respectful person that she is, to keep abreast of what I’m doing and to share her
                            experiences, such as teaching French and Hebrew, with me. My Uncle Lionel
                            appreciates my interest in language and enjoys any chance he can get to speak to
                            me in French. They have both been supportive during the writing of this
                            dissertation.
                                    This dissertation is not just my work - it is the culmination of the efforts,
                            well-wishes and love of all the people I have mentioned above. Thank you a ll!

                            This dissertation examines the syntax, semantics, and morphology of comparative
                            constructions and other degree constructions in English, Spanish, and San Lucas
                            Quiavinf Zapotec. Previous descriptions and analyses of comparatives in English
                            and Spanish are reviewed. New data from San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec, involving
                            comparisons, other degree expressions, and other lexical and functional
                            morphemes, is presented. Attention is called to MUCH, the abstract adjectival
                            quantifier contained in English much and many, SLQZ zye:einy, zi-'i’lly, and
                             -dya’I-tya’, and any Spanish degree adverbial showing number and gender
                            agreement, but not inherently in mucho, an allomorph of muy. In SLQZ, the
                            sequence MUCH-ER is transparently segmentable as such in amount comparisons
                            (contra English and Spanish), ER being the morpheme inherent in comparisons of

                            inequality. In other degree constructions explored in English, Spanish, and SLQZ,
                            the nominal system consistently provides a QP slot occupied by a form of MUCH,
                            contra the adjectival system (with certain exceptions such as in the case
                            ofdifferent). Non-predicative nominal expressions interact with a Deg only via the
                            intermediary of MUCH, whereas most adjectives must interact directly with a Deg.
                            Therefore, there are two instances of more and mas:: (i) the instance used in
                            amount comparisons, subdividable into MUCH (plus agreement) and ER, and (ii)
                            the instance used in adjectival degree comparisons, containing only ER. NEG
                            combines with: (i) MUCH plus agreement to form little, few, poco, or du:u’zh,
                            plus ER to form less, menos, or du:u’zhru’ in the nominal system, or (ii) nothing
                            else to form poco or wzhi:i:a' in adjectival system (note lexical gap in English),
                            plus ER to form less, menos, or uzhi:i:eru’ in adjectival system. Subordination
                            and coordination are shown to not be consistently distinguishable on syntactic
                            grounds. ER complementation is typically either via a preposition plus numeral,
                            measure phrase, or degree relative, or via an adversative conjunction structure.
                            The former type is introduced by de in Spanish and ta ’ or cah (with subsequent
                            nih) in SLQZ, whereas the latter type is introduced by que in Spanish and cah
                            (without nih) or lohoh in SLQZ. Both types are introduced by than in English.

                             Introduction
                                     In this dissertation I discuss a complex linguistic phenomenon displaying
                             great variety across languages - comparative constructions. Comparisons, both
                             those which fall syntactically within the range of what I will later delineate as com­
                             parative constructions, and others in general, serve a fundamental role in the inter­
                             pretation of a large number of properties. This is so because many properties that
                             we attribute to objects are not absolute but are instead held by those objects in vary­
                             ing degrees. For example, consider the sentences in (1):

                             (1)    a.       Los Angeles is big.
                                     b.      Jupiter is big.
                                     Both sentences may be true, but by no stretch of the imagination are Los
                             Angeles and Jupiter of the same size. Thus, in (1) the property of being big is un­
                             derstood within an implicit context - Los Angeles is relatively big among the set of
                             all cities, and Jupiter is relatively big among the set of all planets.
                                     The relevant context for interpreting the relative value of the property in
                             question can also be expressed explicitly. For example, one can use a prepositional
                             phrase introduced by for followed by the class of objects to which the entity under
                             discussion belongs:
                             (2)    a.       Los Angeles is big for a dty.
                                     b.      Jupiter is big for a planet.
                                     That is, Los Angeles is big compared to the size of a typical city, and Jupiter
                             is big com pared to the size of a typical planet This is the most likely type of inter­
                             pretation for sentences like those in (1), although the discourse context may of
                             course provide a standard of “bigness”, i.e., size, different from the overall class of
                             objects that the entity in question belongs to (cf. (5b), (5d), (6), and (7) below, for
                             example).
                                     The type offor construction seen in (2) may also be used in relation to prop-




                                                                           1

                                     b.       Lupe runs really fast for a five-year-old.
                                     Here, Alicia works a lot of hours off campus compared to other students,
                             and Lupe runs really fast compared to other five-year-olds.
                                     Another strategy that is available, if the property under discussion is realized
                            as an adjective, is to place the adjective in prenominal position with respect to a
                            noun representing the class of objects that the object in question belongs to:
                             (4)     a.       Los Angeles is a big city,
                                     b.       Jupiter is a big planet.
                                     A third strategy used to specify the degree to which an entity holds a given
                            property is through the use of a complex prepositional expression such as relative
                            to, compared to, in comparison to, compared with, or in comparison with, which
                            may be followed either by a class of objects or an individual entity:
                            (5)      a.       Los Angeles is (very / relatively) big {compared to / in comparison
                                                     to / in comparison with / compared with} other cities.
                                     b.       Los Angeles is (very) big relative to other cities.
                                     c.       Los Angeles is (very / relatively) big {compared to / in comparison
                                                     to / in comparison with / compared with} San Francisco.
                                     d.       Los Angeles is (very) big relative to San Francisco.
                                     e.       Los Angeles has a relatively large amount of crime {compared to I in
                                                     comparison to / in comparison with / compared with} other
                                                     cities.

                                                     cities.

                                                     Francisco.

                                                     Francisco.

                                     This type of comparative strategy will prove relevant in Chapter 5 with re­
                             gard to a particular type of comparative construction in San Lucas Quiavim Zapotec.

                                      Another strategy for indicating the degree to which a property is held by an
                             entity, of a somewhat different nature, is to use a superlative, as in (6):
                             (6)      a.     Jupiter is the largest of all the planets in our solar system,
                                      b.     Los Angeles is the largest city in California
                             In this type of construction, an entity is envisioned as holding a certain property to a
                             greater degree than any other entity in its class. I will not be addressing superla­
                             tives in this dissertation.
                                      Even though properties like being big are not absolute, we nevertheless
                             often appear to treat them as such from the look of the syntactic form they take.
                             This occurs, for example, when we choose another object which holds the same
                             property to a lesser or greater degree as the first object and treating either it or the
                             first entity, respectively, as though it did not possess the relevant property at all.
                             Note the following contrasts:
                             (7)      a.     Los Angeles is big, but Cuernavaca isn’t,
                                      b.     The moon isn’t big, but Jupiter is.
                                      Cuernavaca is denied the property of being big but only in comparison with
                             Los Angeles, and likewise, the moon is not considered to be big when compared
                             with the planet Jupiter. Similarly, Los Angeles and Jupiter are granted the property
                             of being big but only relative to Cuernavaca and the moon, respectively. All four
                             objects have some size - whether their size is considered to be large or not depends
                             on what serves as our reference point These all-or-nothing judgments are mere
                             conveniences for classifying the objects in our world relative to each other since the
                             property in question is not understood in absolute terms. In a different context,
                             Cuernavaca and the moon might very well be considered big by the same speaker
                             who would utter (7):
                             (8)      a.      Cuernavaca is big, but the village I come from isn’t.
                                      b.      The moon is big, but that lunar vehicle on its surface isn’t.
                                      Gradable properties, then, are understood not in absolute terms but either in




                                                                           3

                             comparison to a covert standard, such as (a typical member of) the class of objects
                             to which the object under study belongs, or in comparison to an overt standard. An
                             overt standard may be the overall class of objects to which the object under study
                             belongs, a distinct individual or set of objects, or even a cardinal amount or degree
                             expressed in the form of a number or measure phrase. This last case will be exem­
                             plified in Chapter 3.
                                      The existence of gradable properties, then, necessitates the existence of
                             comparisons, either covert or overt This notion is captured within the often quoted
                             (e.g., in Stassen (1985) and Price (1990)), illustrative description given by Small
                             (1929, pp. 12-13) of the cognitive function of comparisons:
                                 the speaker who uses comparison as a means of indicating the intensity of a given quality in
                                 an object casts about in his mind for a second object well known to the hearer which has that
                                 same quality, perhaps in a greater or lesser degree. If he is fortunate enough to hit upon a sec­
                                 ond object that, to the best of his judgement [sic], has the quality in exactly the same degree
                                 as the object he is discussing, he may indicate the intensity of the quality by equating the first
                                 object with the second, thus: John is as tall as the gate-post, or, The dog runs as rapidly as
                                 the bird flies. Instead of a second object of comparison the speaker may also refer to a second
                                 condition of the first object itself, thus: John is just as accurate as he was in the rifle match a
                                 year ago. This way of pointing out the intensity of a given attribute may be termed the
                                 comparison o f equality.
                                       Should the hypothetical speaker be unable to hit upon a second object or condition that
                                 exactly matches the first in the quality observed, or should he desire to contrast the first object
                                 with the second, he will call up to the attention of the hearer another object having the same
                                 quality, but either in a higher or lower degree of intensity. Thus: John is taller than Mary ;
                                 Dogs are friendlier than cats; The patient is now weaker than he way ; the poet wrote more
                                 vividly than the artist painted. This sort of thing may best be referred to as the comparison
                                 o f inequality.

                                      All the examples given here by Small fall within a very specific syntactic
                             type of realization available for comparisons, namely those which I delineate as
                             comparative constructions per se —X as much as Y (in comparisons of equality), on
                             the one hand, and X more than Y or X less than Y (in comparisons of inequality),
                             on the other, where X is a proposition and Y is a clause or phrase. The two latter
                             schema comprise, in fact, the range of expressions that will receive the primary
                             focus in this dissertation.

                                      Note that there are many other syntactic manifestations of comparisons. For
                             example, recall the sentences in (2) and (3), repeated here, where one entity is com­
                             pared to typical members within the same set of objects:
                             (2)     a.      Los Angeles is big for a city,
                                      b.     Jupiter is big for a planet.
                             (3)     a.      Alicia works a lot of hours off campus for a student,
                                      b.     Lupe runs really fast for a five-year-old.
                                     These sentences meet Small’s functional description of comparisons, specif­
                             ically comparisons of inequality, and in fact, they may be paraphrased to more
                             closely mirror syntactically the examples he gives:
                             (2’)    a.      Los Angeles is bigger than the average city / an average city / a typi­
                                                       cal city / other cities,
                                     b.      Jupiter is bigger than the average planet / an average planet / a typi­
                                                       cal planet / other planets.
                             (3 ’)   a.      Alicia works more hours off campus than a typicalstudent / an aver­
                                                     age student / other students,
                                     b.      Lupe runs (much) faster than an average five-year-old / a typical
                                                     five-year-old / other five-year-olds.
                                     The strategy of using an adnominal adjective in (4) also falls within the de­
                             scription of comparisons proposed by Small, and it, too, may be paraphrased so as
                             to parallel his examples syntactically (cf.(2’)).
                                     Examples (7) (repeated here) and (8) are also examples of constructions
                             which fit Small’s description of comparisons (of inequality in this case) and yet
                             which do not look like his examples in form:
                             (7)     a.      Los Angeles is big, but Cuernavaca isn’t,
                                      b.     The moon isn’t big, but Jupiter is.
                                     Stassen actually includes this type of comparison amongthe major world
                             types of comparative constructions, although English also permits the less all-or-
                             nothing comparative type exemplified in the passage above from Small and imitated
                             here for (7):

                             (7’)    a.        Los Angeles is bigger than Cuernavaca (is),
                                     b.        The moon isn’t as big as Jupiter (is).
                                      In (7a), one gets the immediate impression that Cuernavaca is not big at all,
                             even though as I explained earlier, it is impossible for a physical object to have no
                             size at all. In (7’a), however, Cuernavaca might very well be big, just not as big as
                             Los Angeles.
                                      Similarly, the moon is claimed to completely lack the property of being big
                             in (7b), whereas the weaker claim that it merely holds that property to a lesser de­
                             gree is what (7’b) expresses.
                                      Despite the synchronic syntactic differences betwen (7) and (7’), I should
                             point out that it has been claimed (e.g., Stassen (1985)) that comparatives such as
                             those in (7’a) are in fact derived historically from the type of structures shown in
                             (7a).
                                      I will not treat in detail comparisons of equality, that is comparisons such as
                             (7’b) with or without a negation. Stassen (p. 15) similarly avoids discussing com­
                             parisons of equality - witness the following semantic definition that he proposes of
                             what qualifies as a COMPARATIVE CONSTRUCTION:
                                 Definition: a construction in a natural language counts as a comparative construction... if that
                                 construction has the semantic function of assigning a graded (i.e., non-identical) position
                                 on a predicative scale to two (possibly complex) objects, [emphasis mine]

                                      Nor will I say much about constructions which may taken to be construc­
                             tions but which are not of the syntactic type X more than Y, X less than Y, or X as
                             much as Y. For example, I will not discuss metaphors, similes, or anthropomor-
                             phidzations, such as in (9), (10), and (11), respectively:

                             ingness to follow the leader no matter where he leads them. In (10), the hearer’s
                            room is apparently very messy and/or dirty, just as a pig sty would be expected to
                            be. In (11), the earth is treated as though it were a live animal capable of being
                            angry and willfully making a loud, threatening sound, even though this is not pos­
                            sible in any literal sense.
                                     Such comparisons can be paraphrased in such a way so to appear more like
                            one of the types of quantitative comparisons, specifically comparisons of equality,
                            treated earlier:
                            (9’) Your followers are (every bit) as gullible / obedient as sheep.
                            (10’) Your room is as messy and dirty as a pig sty.
                            (11’) The earth made as loud and vehement a sound as an angry animal would
                                         make.
                                     The constructions in (9)-(l 1) might also be paraphrased as qualitative com­
                            parisons (i.e., involving referential identity or non-identity) rather than as quantita­
                            tive comparatives (i.e., involving degree of a shared property):
                            (9”)  Your followers are just like sheep. / Your followers act the same way (as)
                                          sheep would. / Your followers act like sheep would.
                            (10”) Your room has the same type of unattractiveness as a pig sty.
                            (11”) The earth made the same kind of noise as you would expect an angry animal
                                          to.
                                     Qualitative comparisons also include dissimilarities in quality:
                            (12)    You aren’t anything like me.
                            (13)    You are different from / than me.
                                     Qualitative comparisons often do not involve degree at all. That is, they are
                            either all or nothing:
                            (14)    I bought the same book as you did.
                            (15)    I bought a different book than you did.
                                     Qualitative comparisons receive little attention in this dissertation, although
                            they will be discussed briefly in Chapter 4. Much of what I wish to discuss in­

                                     The dissertation is set up as follows:
                                      Chapter 1 outlines the theoretical framework assumed in the dissertation.
                                     Chapter 2 provides some general background information on San Lucas
                            Quiavinf Zapotec.
                                     Chapter 3 presents the terminology needed to discuss the comparative con­
                            structions in Spanish, SLQZ, and English contained in the dissertation and estab­
                            lishes the issues that must be dealt with in the remaining chapters.
                                     Chapter 4 refines the semantic notion of compared property, the syntactic
                            notion of the head of a comparison and discusses the syntax of the comparative
                            morpheme ER.
                                     Chapter 5 explores the syntax of the constituent serving as a standard of
                            comparison in some types of comparative constructions.
                                     Chapter 6 concludes the dissertation with a brief overview of what has been
                            accomplished in the course of the previous chapters.

                             Chapter 1 Theoretical assumptions
                                     Many elements of this dissertation are compatible with various theoretical
                             orientations. This is due in part to the fact that I have attempted to provide a largely
                             descriptive contribution to the body of linguistic investigation in addition to any the­
                             oretical contributions.
                                     Nevertheless, there is an underlying current of generative syntax. For the
                             most part, I follow the Extended Standard Theory (EST) as described by Chomsky
                             in his Lectures on Government and Binding (1981).
                                     First, I note that I adopt the so-called T-shaped model as the schematic rep­
                             resentation of a linguistic structure:
                             (1)              D-str


                                              S-str


                             PF                                LF
                             In this model, a given linguistic structure is associated with various levels, one of
                             which is the interface of all the others, namely S-str. D-str, often thought of as the
                             underlying structure, represents the satisfaction of lexical thematic roles (see discus­
                             sion below). PF (Phonological form) and LF (Logical Form) represent interfaces
                             with extra-linguistic systems: the speech-production motor system and the cogni­
                             tive-interpretive system, respectively.
                                     In EST, several modules of grammar are proposed. Of the various modules
                             of the grammar identified within EST, the ones that are especially relevant for the
                             present work are theta theory, X’-theory, trace theory, and case theory.
                                     Theta theory concerns itself with the fact that predicates are subcategorized
                             in the lexicon for one or several arguments of a specific type of syntactic category
                             or of various types of syntactic categories. For example, the verb kill, in its literal




                                                                           9

                             sense, is subcategorized for an agent and a patient, both of which must be animate
                             entities manifested as noun phrases.1 The verb know, on the other hand, selects a
                             theme in the form of a noun phrase, an embedded declarative clause, or an embed­
                             ded interrogative clause. It is not as clear what the selectional properties of abstract
                             and/or functional elements, such as the comparative morpheme ER, are - this issue
                             is less intuitive and straightforward.
                                      One formal element of theta theory is a requirement called the theta-criterion.
                             Stated by Chomsky (1981, p.36, example #4), “Each argument bears one and only
                             one theta-role, and each theta-role is assigned to one and only one argument”
                             Thus, there can be no arguments in a sentence which do not fill a theta-role of any
                             predicate, and by the same token, enough arguments must be present in order to fill
                             all of the available theta-roles since no given argument can do doubly duty. This
                             follows from the conception of D-str and the Projection Principle adopted here.2
                                      I assume that at D-str, a sentence is constructed according to X-bar theory
                             and lexical subcategorization properties. In the version of X-bar theory that I
                             adopt, lexical heads project a specifier position and a complement position, in con­
                             formance with the schema in (2), where YP and ZP are in specifier and complement
                             position, respectively. I assume that each of these two positions may only be occu­
                             pied by a maximal, i.e., phrasal, projection. The symbol X° stands for a lexical
                             head, and X ’ stands for the single bar level projection of X°, which is neither a
                             head nor a maximal projection but is instead an intermediate type of position.

                                     Note that only binary branching is allowed in such a schema. No ternary or
                             higher-order branching is allowed. Although I do not enter into the argumentation
                            here, such a constrained structure can be derived by Kayne’s (1994) LINEAR COR­
                            RESPONDENCE AXIOM.         Essentially, this axiom requires the terminal nodes of syn­
                             tactic trees to observe strict ordering as determined by dominance and asymmetric c-
                            command of non-terminal nodes. Only the types of binary structures proposed here
                            can meet the conditions that Kayne outlines.
                                     Kayne’s (1994) Antisymmetry framework also rules out rightward and/or
                            downward movement. Rightward extraposition, for example, is not allowed in his
                            framework. Instead, what appears to have been extraposed to the right has actually
                            been stranded, while the related constituent appearing to the left has been “intra­
                            posed” to the left. I will adopt Kayne’s position on such matters.
                                     A sentence uttered by a speaker is not identical to the sentence’s D-str, i.e.,
                            the underlying structure as described above. Instead, various elements move via
                            transformations, motivated by morphological and interpretative considerations,
                            eventually yielding an S-str, which corresponds roughly to the notion of SPELLOUT
                            in Chomsky’s (1993) more recent Minimalist Program. The S-str more or less re­
                            sembles the uttered string, except that the S-str must first undergo any phonological
                            rules occurring atPF (Phonological Form) before being shuttled off to the speech-
                            production motor system.
                                     The structure at S-str is also subject to covert transformations which fulfill
                            any morphological or interpretative requirements not yet met by S-str. The result of
                            these transformations is the level called LF (Logical Form). Languages vary as to
                            which transformations occur prior to S-str (overt transformations) and which occur
                            afterwards (covert transformations). Although I do not particularly adopt
                            Chomsky’s M inim alist Program, I signal it as an interesting account of cross-lin­
                             guistic differences with respect to overt (i.e., pre-Spellout) vs. covert (i.e., post-
                            Spellout) transformations.

                                      The transformations that occur between D-str and S-str and between S-str
                             and LF are not unconstrained. Such transformations have locality restrictions.
                             Some of these constraints on transformations are language-specific while others are
                             universal. Some of the latter include the STRUCTURE-PRESERVING PRINCIPLE and
                             the PROJECTION PRINCIPLE. The first of these two constraints prevents, among
                             other things, heads from occupying phrasal positions and phrases from occupying
                             head positions under transformational modifications. The latter, proposed by
                             Chomsky (1981, p.29), states that “representations at each syntactic level (i.e., LF,
                             and D- and S-structure) are projected from the lexicon in that they observe the sub­
                             categorization properties of lexical items.” That is, elements with semantic content
                             (predicates or arguments) cannot simply be removed from a tree, although they may
                             be moved to a new position, as long as a sufficiently local anaphoric relationship
                             between the new position and original position is established. I will assume that a
                             moved element leaves a trace in the position in which it originates. Note that the ex­
                             istence of traces presupposes that silent categories may exist in the structure of a
                             sentence. Trace theory concerns itself with the legitimacy of traces in terms of the
                             position of their antecedent
                                      Case theory is an attempt to account for the distribution of overt noun phras­
                             es3based on their ability to receive or check case-marking in the position or posi­
                             tions they originate in or come to occupy at some later point in the sentence’s
                             derivation. Some languages do not mark case overtly in the morphology, whereas
                             others do, but it is assumed by Chomsky (1981), following suggestions of
                             Vergnaud’s (1981) that all overt noun phrases need to receive case at least abstract­
                             ly. Otherwise they violate the CASE FILTER, which is simply a stipulative bar on
                             any overt noun phrase without case.
                                      An attempt to explain the Case Filter is the notion of VISIBILITY. According
                             to Haegeman (1991, p. 177), “A predicate can only assign a theta role to NP’s that

                                 31 will take the relevant entity to be DP’s rather than NP’s.




                                                                              12

                             are visible. Abstract case renders an NP visible.” Thus, case allows noun phrases
                             to be eligible to serve as arguments for predicates. From this point of view, case
                             theory and theta theory are intricately related.

                             The functional head analysis
                                     Abney (1987) proposes that noun phrases are actually headed by determin­
                             ers rather than norms. That is, he rules out the structure in (3) in favor of the struc­
                             ture in (4):
                             (3)                                        (4)

                             Thus, rather than being base-generated in the specifier position of the NP the lin­
                             guist as a determiner phrase, the determiner the takes an NP as a complement As
                             discussed in Chapter 4, Corver (1997) proposes that this motif should be general­
                             ized so that functional categories always take lexical phrases as their complement
                             rather than being base-generated in their specifier position. That is, Corver favors a
                             FUNCTIONAL HEAD ANALYSIS           over a LEXICAL HEAD ANALYSIS. I also adopt this
                             position.

                             Chapter 2 An Introduction to San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec1

                             2.0 General Introduction
                                     This chapter presents a brief description of San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec
                             (henceforth SLQZ), in order that the data and discussions pertaining to SLQZ in the
                             remaining chapters of this dissertation may be optimally appreciated.
                                     SLQZ is spoken in San Lucas Quiavinf in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. It
                             belongs to the Zapotecan language family, which in turn belongs to the
                             Otomanguean stock. Within the Zapotecan language family, mutual intelligibility
                             declines rapidly within relatively short distances. It is not uncontroversial how
                             many Zapotec languages there are. Terrence Kaufman (p.c.) currently believes that
                             “there are five divisions in Zapotec: Northern Zapotec, Central/Eastern Zapotec,
                             Southern Zapotec, Papabuco Zapotec, and Solteco Zapotec. Zapotecan has 6
                             branches, adding Chatino to Zapotec.. .Northern may include 3-4 languages,
                             Central/Eastern 2-3 languages [of which one is SLQZ], and Southern 2 languages,
                             for a total of about 10 languages. Some of these languages have serious internal di­
                             versification at the dialect level.” Pamela Munro (p.c.), on the other hand, feels that
                             there are actually many more Zapotec languages, on the order of 50-60.



                                 1This description is based quite heavily on the introduction to an SLQZ dictionary in prepara­
                            tion by Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation), to which I refer the reader for a more detailed descrip­
                            tion. Some of the data is also taken from the SLQZ dictionary.
                                 Additionally, Pamela Munro, to whom I am very grateful, checked almost all of the SLQZ
                            spelling of the data which I elicited from Rodrigo Garcia, and she elicited a large part of the SLQZ
                            data for me.
                                 Lastly, the remaining data comes from my own notes and the notes shared among the mem­
                            bers of the SLQZ group, i.e., myself, Pamela Munro, and the students who took field methods in
                            the fall of 1994in the linguistics department at UCLA, taught by Pamela Munro. The students
                            who took that class were Virgina Casillas, Cristopher Garcia, Felicia Lee, Olivia Mdndez, Marie
                            Provost, AriaRazfar, Cynthia Walker, and Ada Wan.
                                 I am also extremely grateful to my primary consultant, Rodrigo Garcia, who has given me
                            countless hours of his time so that I could obtain data, as well as Felipe Lopez, who has also
                            given me some data.
                                 I of course assume all responsibility for any errors in the data and/or the description of SLQZ.

                            2.1.1 Consonants
                                        SLQZ, like other Zapotecan languages, shows a Ienis / fortis contrast in
                            most of its consonant inventory (Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation)). With stops
                            and fricatives, this distinction correlates roughly to a voiced / voiceless contrast.
                            More generally, the lenis vs. fortis contrast is accompanied by a relatively longer or
                            shorter duration, respectively, of a preceding vowel.2
                                        The SLQZ consonant inventory in the orthography of Munro, Lopez, et al.
                            (in preparation) is as shown in the following table:

                             Notes:

                             1. The phonemes lil and /j/ occur primarily in loan words. Nevertheless, they apparently be­
                             have as other fortis consonants do.

                             2. The phoneme /g/ is spelled g everywhere except before the vowels i and e, where it is spelled
                             gu-

                             3.    The phoneme fkl is spelled c everywhere except before the vowels i and e, where it is spelled
                             qu.

                             4. Rr does not appear morpheme-intemally in native SLQZ words but does in Spanish loan
                             words. It also appears at morpheme boundaries in native SLQZ inflected forms. It manifests itself
                             as a trill, behaving phonologically as part of the class of fortis consonants. R , which is a tap and
                             behaves as part of the class of lenis consonants, may appear morpheme-intemally in native SLQZ
                             words.

                             5.    There are no lenis affricates.


                             2.1.2 Vowels and the syllable
                                      The vowels of SLQZ are: a, e, i, e, o, and u. For some speakers, e, which
                             is a high, back, unrounded vowel, occurs almost exclusively in suffixes, whereas
                             for others, it occurs quite freely in stems as well.
                                       \bwels may be plain (unmarked), breathy (indicated by a following h),
                             checked (indicated by a following apostrophe), or creaky (indicated by a following
                             colon). Vowels may occur together in groups of up to three. The syllable template
                             proposed by Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation) is as follows:
                             (1)      CCGV(L)V(L)V(L) CG
                             where C represents a true consonant, G represents a glide, V represents a vowel,
                             and L represents a laryngeal feature (i.e., breathy, checked, or creaky).
                                       According to Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation), there are some words in
                             which a final breathy vowel identical in oral quality to the vowel preceding it, can
                             fail to be realized, if the preceding vowel is either checked or breathy, when the
                             word is uttered nonfinally in a phrase. Hence the word in (2) may be pronounced
                             without the final breathy vowel in a sentence such as (3):




                                                                              16

                             Thus, the reader should not be surprised to encounter SLQZ data in which a given
                             morpheme appears aitematingly with or without a final breathy vowel.
                                       SLQZ is a tone language, but Pamela Munro (p.c.) claims that tone in SLQZ
                             is entirely predictable based on a given vowel’s phonation type as well as the num­
                             ber and phonation type of immediately adjacent vowels.4 In any case, SLQZ tone is
                             not indicated in this dissertation.

                             2.2 Morphosyntax
                             2.2.1 Clausal syntax
                                       The basic word order in SLQZ is VSO. This can be seen in the following
                             example:
                             (4)       B-guhty bzihihny behlld.
                                       perf-kill mouse fish
                                       ‘The mouse killed the fish’
                                       There are, however, several types of exceptions to the basic VSO word
                             order. Elements which may precede the verb include focussed elements (5), quanti­
                             fied elements (6), interrogative elements in wh-questions (5)-(7), a special type of
                             third person independent pronoun called a nominal pronoun (cf. discussion on pro­
                             nouns below), and certain adverbs (8) (including some negative elements - these
                             are discussed below).
                             (5)       Q.       Tu b-ta:a’az Gyeeihlly ?

                                      Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation) indicate that SLQZ rarely shows overt
                             markers of subordination. Very often related sentences simply abut one another,
                             i.e., they appear in a paratactic configuration. For example, the only difference be­
                             tween (9) and (10) is that there is a subordinating matrix verb in (9) but none in
                             ( 10):
                             (9)      Zyuu:a’ll Lieeb.
                                        tall     Felipe
                                      ‘Felipe is tall’
                             (10)         N-aiann-a’ zyuu:a’ll Lieeb.
                                      neut-know-lsg      tall Felipe
                                      ‘I know that Felipe is tall’
                                      Munro, Lopez, et al. also point out that there is almost no morphological
                             distinction between finite and nonfinite clauses. Verbs that would appear in the in­
                             finitive form in languages with infinitives are translated by finite verbs in SLQZ,


                                 ° This abbreviation, which I use for space considerations, indicates that the SLQZ word
                             zye:einy translates into English as ‘many’ when found before a plural count noun and ‘much’ when
                             found before a solid mass noun or an abstract noun. Similarly, the word zi:i ’lly will be glossed as
                             ‘MUCH.liq/gas’, since this word is used before liquid and gas mass nouns, always translating into
                             English as ‘much’.
                                 7 This verb also means ‘read’, but I will continue to gloss it as ‘sing’ for consistency.
                                 8 The element ra is used to mark plurality but does not occur everywhere plurality would in
                             languages such as English and Spanish.

                                     Speakers of SLQZ often use subordinators borrowed from Spanish in order
                            to approximate subordination structures when translating from English or Spanish
                            into SLQZ. For example, the English word since and the Spanish word desde can
                            sometimes be translated as dehsdeh in SLQZ, as in (13):
                            (13)    Dehsdeh b-zehnny-a’ b-yu’la:a:a’z-a’ ru’c.

                                    ‘Since (the) time I arrived I liked it here’
                                     Similarly, the English word before and the Spanish expression antes (de)
                            que can sometimes be translated as antehsdeh nih in SLQZ, as shown in (14):
                            (14)    Antehsdeh nih ch-iia Gyeeihlly No’rt n-a:a pahrch-iia Gyeeihlly

                                    ‘Before Mike goes to the US, he has to go to church’
                                     One of the few types of overt subordination in SLQZ using a native subor-
                            dinator is relativization, of which one type of comparative structure is a subcase, as
                            I claim in Chapter 5. I will exemply the comparative subcase in Chapter 3, but I
                            present here a non-comparative relative clause for the sake of illustration:
                            (15)    Liebrnih b-de:e:i’dy Lieeb studya’aannd             n-u’ re:e’.

                                     ‘The book that Felipe gave to a student is here’
                            Note that the word nih, which I claim is a relative pronoun, appears only in relative


                                9 The irrealis aspect also corresponds to many instances of the subjunctive mood in languages
                            such as Spanish.
                                10 Chapulines are a type of edible grasshopper.

                                     Matrix yes/no questions are formed by the particle e:ee which is postclitic to
                             the entire sentence, whereas matrix wh-questions are formed by raising the question
                             word to sentence-initial position. A yes/no question is exemplified in (16), whereas
                             a matrix wh-question can be seen above in (7).

                                     ‘Will Mike arrive tomorrow ?’
                                     Negation is expressed in various ways, the most common of which is the
                            following: the negative element cei’ty is prefixed to the verbal complex while
                            -dya’ is simultaneously suffixed directly to the verb stem. SLQZ is a negative con­
                            cord language (Lee (1996)).
                             (17)   Cei’ty       ca:a’-dya’ Cri’sy liebr x:te:e’n-ni’.

                                    ‘Chrisj doesn’t have hisj book’

                                     Another type of negation can be seen in (18), in which the negative element
                            a’ti’zh: precedes a predicate nominative:
                            (18)    A’ti’-zh:       x:-liebr asu’all-u’ nnde:e’.

                                 " In fact, Lee (1997) takes nih to be a complementizer, basing this claim on causatives such
                            as (i) [gloss is Lee’s]:
                                 (i) X:-la’mm-eng b-e:e:i’ny nih b-gwah-ng loh gyihzhya’ah.

                                       ‘His boss caused him to cut the grass’
                                 Although this is not an unreasonable claim, I take nih in (i) to be a relative pronoun indicat­
                            ing the notion of ‘a state of affairs in which’, a sort of headless relative. In other words, (i) means
                            something like:
                                 (ii) {His boss brought about (lit., made) a state of affairs in which he cut the grass.)
                                 Here and henceforth, I use curly brackets to indicate an interpretation for a preceding string, re­
                            gardless of whether the preceding string is grammatical or whether the interpretation is a grammati­
                            cal sentence.

                             2.2.2 Verbs and pronouns
                                      The verb stem consists of an aspectual prefix, a theme,13and sometimes ad­
                             ditional elements such as valence suffixes or incorporated lexical items. The theme
                             may be complex, containing not only a verb root but also causative and directional
                             elements (Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation, Introduction)).
                                      The aspects which occur in SLQZ are as follows: Habitual, Perfective,
                             Irrealis, Progressive, Definite, Subjunctive, and Neutral. It should be noted that
                             the aspect markers in SLQZ represent not only aspect but also tense and modality. I
                             refer the reader to Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation, Introduction) for a descrip­
                             tion of the uses of each aspect as well as the shapes that the various aspectual pre­
                             fixes usually take, but I exemplify each of these aspects with the verb meaning ‘put
                             on (a shirt)’ in SLQZ:14

                             incorporated to it, such as body parts. For example the word la:a:a’z ‘heart’ is in­

                                  15 There are cases where one of these words may occur without the other, although the in­
                             stances of -dya’ that occur without cei’t y indicate things other than negation, such as extent, and
                             may constitute a separate lexical item. In any case, this template is general enough for the purpos­
                             es of this dissertation.

                                  ,s Nominal pronouns are a special type of third person independent pronoun discussed in
                             Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation. Introduction) which precede a verb but are not mirrored by a
                             matching SAM. They may express either a subject or a focussed object. As none of the data in
                             this dissertation exemplifies nominal pronouns, I refer the reader to Munro, Lopez, et al. (in prepa­
                             ration, Introduction) for a complete list of them.
                                  17 This chart is based on information from Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation).
                                  '* R.G. and F.L. are abbreviations for Rodrigo Garcia and Felipe Lopez, respectively, the two
                             p rim a ry consultants for the SLQZ data. They do not use the same set of SAM’s as one another to
                             represent second person formal, so the forms that each gives are mentioned here.
                                  19 Pamela Munro claims (p.c.) that the two forms given for the singular reverential clitic pro­
                             nouns occur in free variation, as do the two forms given for the singular reverential independent
                             pronouns. Also, there is another suffix -ni' which functions as an anaphoric possessive pronoun
                             (Munro (1995)). I abbreviate it a s ‘3sg.anaposs’.

                                      Of the six different third person SAM’s, I restrict data in this dissertation to
                             the proximate type most of the time, so I will simply gloss all third person SAM’s
                             as third person singular or plural except where the type is other than proximate, in
                             which case I mention the type.
                                      An independent pronoun may surface before the verb in order to receive
                             focus, but if it corresponds to the subject of the sentence, then it must be mirrored
                             by an overt copy of the matching SAM suffixed to the verb, as in (30):
                             (30)     Laranng b-da’uhw-eng comiied.
                                        3sg perf-eat-3sg    food
                                      ‘HE ate the food’
                                      Pronominal objects may be expressed in one of two ways. First, they may
                             be expressed by the independent pronouns given in Table 2.3, following the sub­
                            ject, whether the subject is a SAM (31) or an independent lexical norm (32):
                             (31)     R-yu’laa:a’z-eng na:a’.
                                        hab-like-3sg    lsg
                                      ‘He likes me’
                             (32)     R-yu’la:a:a’z Jwaany na:a’.
                                       hab-like      Juan lsg
                                      ‘Juan likes me’
                                      Alternatively, in the case of some third person objects, one of the two
                             SAM’s -eng (3sg. proximate) and -ih (3sg. distal) may be used, either enclitic to the
                             complex formed by the verb stem plus any SAM if present (33), or enclitic to an in­
                             dependent nominal subject if present (34):
                             (33)     R-umbe:e’-nn-ih.
                                      hab-know-lpl-3sg.dist
                                      ‘We know him’

                             (34)     R-umbe:e’ Jwaany-ih.20
                                      hab-know     Juan-3sg.dist
                                      ‘Juan knows him’
                                 20 Note that a construction parallel to the examples in (31) and (32), i.e., sentences with third
                             person independent pronouns, may also be used to express the meaning of (34):
                                 (i) R-umbe:e’ Jwaany laianng.
                                      hab-know Juan 3sg
                                      ‘Juan knows him.’




                                                                              24

                                      It should be noted that SLQZ pronouns do not show gender. Therefore, I
                             will usually translate SLQZ third person pronouns and suffixes using masculine
                             pronouns in English and Spanish, although this is merely a convention used for the
                             sake of exposition and should be understood as such.

                             2.2.3 Prepositions
                                      Pronominal objects of native SLQZ prepositions are indicated with the ap­
                             propriate SAM’s, as shown in (35), whereas pronominal objects of prepositions
                             borrowed from Spanish are indicated with independent pronouns, as shown in
                             (36):
                             (35)    De’ts-a’     zuu      mee’s.
                                     back-lsg neutstand table
                                     ‘The table is behind me’
                             (36)    Z-ya:all-a’    cehnn la:anng.
                                     def-come-lsg with 3sg
                                     ‘I came with him’
                                     Native SLQZ prepositions are identical to body part words.21 One such
                             preposition, which is used in some comparisons, is lohoh, which literally means
                             ‘face’ but is used to introduce some locative (37) and dative (38) complements and
                             the standard of comparison in some types of comparisons ((39) and further ex­
                             plained in Chapter 3):
                             (37)    Liebr zurubloh mee’s.
                                     book neutsit face table
                                     ‘There’s a book on the table’
                             (38)      B-cwa:a:-a’ Jwaany pelo’t loh Beed.

                                     ‘Juan threw the ball to Pedro’



                                 21 Under some analyses, in fact, these might be taken to be nouns rather than prepositions.
                             However, some of these SLQZ nouns-qua-prepositions correspond, in meaning and distribution, to
                             prepositional expressions in English containing nominal expressions, such as in f r o n t of, be­
                             side, instead of, on to p of, behind, and the like.




                                                                            25

                             2.2.4 Nouns and their modifiers
                                     Nouns are not morphologically case-marked in SLQZ. Plural nouns are
                             sometimes preceded by the proclitic plural marker ra, as in (40), but this is not al­
                             ways the case.
                             (40)    R-umbi:-a’      ra studya’aann.

                                     ‘I know the students’
                                     The distribution of ra has not been studied in detail, hence an analysis of its
                             behavior is not yet possible.
                                      Some nouns may never be possessed, others optionally so, while yet oth­
                             ers obligatorily so. A possessed noun is usually simply prefixed by x:-, as in (41):
                             (41)    a.       liebr
                                               ‘book’
                                     b.         x:-liebr Lieeb

                                     However, this is not always the case. One example where it is not the case
                             can be seen in (42), where the possessed word meaning ‘house’ is lexically unrelat­
                             ed to the non-possessed word meaning ‘house’ and is not prefixed by x :-:
                             (42)    a.       yu’uh
                                               ‘house’

                                     Some nouns are obligatorily possessed. Of these, some, such as ru’uh
                             ‘mouth’, are not preceded by the prefix x:-, while others, such as x:azhi’ih ‘nape’,




                                                                          26

                                     Sometimes the prefixation of x:- causes predictable changes in a noun such
                             as converting an initial lenis consonant into a fortis consonant, as in (45), but the
                             prefixation of x:- may instead cause unpredictable changes in a noun, as in (46).

                                     A possessed noun is followed either by a nominal possessor (cf. (42)-(46),
                             above) or by an appropriate SAM (47):
                             (47)    x:-pu’uliuhdy-a’
                                     poss-chicken-lsg

                             2.2.5 Adjectives
                                     Elements manifested as adjectives in certain other languages such as English
                             and Spanish may behave syntactically in various ways in SLQZ. First, they may
                             manifest themselves as verbs. That is, they take aspectual prefixes, they take
                             SAM’s in case of a pronominal subject, and they do not occur with a copula (even
                             in the neutral aspect). The following adjectival verb, for example, is shown with




                                                                          27

                                      Secondly, there are adjectives which may optionally cooccur with a copula
                             in any aspect including the neutral aspect, either nu’uh or na:a / na fc (in the appro­
                             priate aspect), this last pair being somewhat interchangeable (Munro, Lopez, et al.
                             (in preparation)):
                             (54)     Xniaa liebr.
                                       red book
                                      ‘The book is red’
                             (55)     Xniaa n-aa liebr.
                                      red neut-be book
                                      ‘The book is red’


                                  22 This verb does not occur in neutral aspect

                             data. Some of those given here with a stative translation can also be used in an inchoative sense
                             and vice-versa.
                                  24 This form is in free variation with the following form in (i)

                                     The copula is apparently required rather than optional in aspects other than
                            the neutral aspect with such adjectives:25
                             (56)    Xniaa g-uhc liebr.
                                      red peif-be book
                                     ‘The book was red’
                             (57)    Xniaa g-a’c liebr.
                                      red irr-be book
                                     ‘The book will be red’
                                     Thirdly, there are some adjectives (58) which in neutral aspect cannot occur
                            with a copula (59), but which Pamela Munro (p.c.) nevertheless does not consider
                            to be verbs, not even in the neutral aspect, an aspect which corresponds to a state of
                            affairs, just like adjectives do:26
                            (58)     Ua’s nsehe’s cabai.
                                      very fast horse
                                     ‘The horse is fast’
                            (59)     *Ua’s nsehe’s n-a:a cabai.
                                       very fast neut-be horse
                                     She justifies this position based on the following four considerations: (i)
                            such adjectives cannot take aspectual prefixes, whereas true verbs do, (ii) such ad­
                            jectives do occur with a copula in aspects other than the neutral aspect ((60)-(61)),
                            whereas true verbs cannot cooccur with a copula in any aspect, (iii) such adjectives
                            may be used attributively (although sometimes requiring an alternate form), where­
                            as true verbs, even in the neutral aspect, can never be used attributively, and (iv),
                            those verbs b eginning with the aspectual prefix n- in the neutral form can never lose
                            this prefix, whereas some adjectives beginning in n- may lose this n when used at­
                            tributively:


                                 25 Either of these two sentences would simply yield (54) if the copula were removed, hence
                            losing perfective or irrealis aspect, respectively.
                                 29 According to Pamela Munro (p.c.) when the particular adjective chosen is used predicatively
                            (rather than attributively), there is a strong preference to include the word ua’s at the beginning of
                            the sentence, which apparently means ‘very’.




                                                                             29

                                     Lastly, there are some adjectives which always require the presence of a
                             copula, either nu’uh or na:a I na’c (in the appropriate aspect):
                             (62)    Asua’ll n-a:a liebr.
                                     blue neut-be book
                                     ‘The book is blue’
                             (63)    *Asu’all liebr.
                                      blue book
                                     If a predicative adjective occurs with a copula, the default word order is ad-
                            jective-copula-subject Hence, (62) is perfectly grammatical, whereas all of the
                            following word orders are either marked or ungrammatical:
                             (64)    Liebr n-a:a asu’all.
                                     book neut-be blue
                                     ‘The BOOK is blue’27

                             (66)    *Asu’all liebr na:a.

                             (68)    *Na:a asu’all liebr.
                                     A predicative adjective used without a copula follows the same word order
                             as an intransitive verb: adjective-subject (69).
                             (69)    Nahll cafee.
                                     cold coffee
                                     ‘The coffee is cold’
                                     If this order is reversed, the string will still be grammatical for those adjec­
                             tives which may be used attributively and whose attributive form is identical to the

                                 27 This could for example be the answer to the question in (i):
                                 (i) Xi n-a:a asu’all ?
                                      what neut-be blue
                                      ‘What’s blue?’

                             sentence:

                                     Adjectives used attributively occur post-nominally and as mentioned above,
                             sometimes have a form distinct from the one used when the adjective is used pred­
                            icate ely.28This idiosyncratic information may be found in Munro, Lopez, et al. (in
                            preparation). The following adjective is given first in its predicative form, with
                             (72) and without (73) a copula, then in its attributive form (74).

                                     ‘Mike’s shirt got tight when he started growing’

                                     There is no definite article in SLQZ although the numeral te’ihby ‘one’
                             sometimes functions as an indefinite article. Other determiners include cardinal
                             numbers (prenominal), demonstratives (postnominal) and quantifiers (prenominal)


                                 28 Some adjectives may not be used attributively at all, such as confo’rmm ‘contented /
                             pleased’ (Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation)). A relative clause must be used instead.

                            Chapter 3 Nomenclature and Issues to be Resolved

                            3.0 Introduction
                                      Comparative constructions are a fascinating object of study involving sever­
                            al different phenomena, some unique to comparatives, others not. In this chapter, I
                            will define several terms often used to describe the fundamental aspects of compara­
                            tive constructions (3.1), and then I will discuss some key issues that arise in the
                            study of comparatives to be addressed in the following chapters (3.2-3.6).

                            3.1 Fundamental Nomenclature

                            3.1.1 The compared property
                                      Recall from the Introduction Stassen’s definition of what qualifies as a COM­
                            PARATIVE CONSTRUCTION:
                                  Definition: a construction in a natural language counts as a comparative construction... if that
                                  construction has the semantic function of assigning a graded (i.e., n on-identical) position
                                  on a predicative scale to two (possibly complex) objects, [emphasis mine]

                                      Thus, comparisons are formed with respect to gradable properties. Such a
                            property is, according to Stassen, a COMPARATIVE PREDICATE corresponding to a
                            PREDICATIVE SCALE.           Consider the following example:
                            (1)      Rodrigo is taller than Felipe.
                                      In (1), the property whose degree is being compared is tallness, i.e., height.
                            This property forms a predicative scale, since some entities possess it to relatively
                            smaller degrees, whereas others possess it to relatively larger degrees. That is,
                            some objects are taller than others. Instead of referring to this property as “the
                            property whose degree is being compared”, I will refer to it instead as the COM­
                            PARED PROPERTY,          even though it is actually its degree and not the property itself
                            which is being compared. Note that the term COMPARED PROPERTY is a semantic
                            notion.




                                                                              33

                                      There are also other terms found in the literature for what I call the com­
                             pared property. Anderson (1983, quoted in Price (1990)), for example, mentions
                             QUALITIES and PROPERTIES         which are used in forming a comparison. Small
                             (1929), as quoted in the Introduction,1refers to a QUALITY possessed by two ob­
                             jects in potentially different amounts which may serve as a basis for comparing one
                             of these objects to the other. Prytz (1979) uses the Spanish term RASGO COMPARA-
                             DO   ‘compared feature', which he defines as “lo que se compara” (‘that which is
                             compared’) in the two terms of the comparison.2
                                      It is not always clear exactly what the compared property is in a given com­
                             parison. I return to this issue in Chapter 4.


                             3.1.2 The morpheme ER
                                     The morphosyntactic elements of comparisons, however, are somewhat
                             more easily identified. For example, there is in many languages, including English,
                             Spanish, and San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec, a morpheme that appears uniquely in
                             comparisons of inequality. In English, it manifests itself either as the suffix -er, as
                             a proper subpart of the word more or the word less, or as the whole word more it­
                             self.3 I will refer to it as ER. Its properties will he discussed briefly later in this
                             chaper and in depth in Chapter 4.
                                      Likewise, there is a similar morpheme which is involved in comparisons of
                             equality instead, which Rivara (1990) terms EG, based on the French word mean­
                             ing ‘equality’: egalite. Recall from the Introduction, however, that not much em­
                             phasis will be placed on comparisons of equality in this dissertation.4



                                 ' I am referring here to the introduction of this dissertation.
                                 21 return shortly to Prytz’s notion of the two terms of the comparison.
                                 31 explain this characterization in more detail and justify it in Chapter 4.
                                 4For data and analysis of comparisons of equality in Romance, the interested reader should
                             consult Price (1990).

                            3.1.3 Head of the comparison
                                     As a syntactic correlate of the compared property, there is often a lexical
                            head which is traditionally assumed to be more intimately tied to ER (or EG in com­
                            parisons of equality) than any other constituent is. I will refine this notion in
                            Chapter 4,5but I provide here an intuitive notion of what I mean in terms of the
                            syntactic manifestation of ER.
                                     Prytz (1979) refers to an element such as ER and EG more generally as a
                            CUANnFICADOR COMPARAITVO ‘comparative quantifier’. He lists the following
                            three CUANTtFICADORES COMPARATIVOS: mas ‘more’, menos ‘less’, and tanto
                            ‘as’. Notice that he treats ER not as one primitive element but as two primitive ele­
                            ments: (i) the positively-oriented mas, involved in what is referred to in traditional
                            grammars as a COMPARISON OF SUPERIORITY, and (ii) the negatively-oriented
                            menos, involved in what is referred to in traditional grammars as a COMPARISON
                            OF INFERIORITY.
                                     I instead take Rivara’s (1990) approach and consider mas and menos to con­
                            tain a common, primitive element - an indication of inequality - with the additional
                            presence of an orientation reverser in the case of menos. I assume with Rivara that
                            the default orientation in measuring amounts is from small quantities to large quanti­
                            ties, and, similarly, that the default orientation for measuring degrees is from small
                            degrees to large degrees. Thus, an orientation reverser, such as few or little (con­
                            tained in fewer or less, for example), inverts the scale so that counting or measuring
                            proceeds from large to small amounts or large to small degrees.
                                     As for the constituent which is “most intimately tied to ER”, Price (1990,
                            p. 10) refers to “categories which may be the OBJECTS OF COMPARISON” [caps
                            mine]. These objects of comparison “range over nouns, adjectives, adverbs,




                                5 The main complications arise in the case of amount comparisons and verbal extent compar­
                            isons.




                                                                          35

                             prepositional phrases, verbs and even whole clauses.”6
                                      To see how such categories are linked to ER, consider the following exam­
                             ples given by Huddleston (1967, p. 92) :7
                             (2)   a.     Mary bought more records than Peter.
                                   b.     Mary achieved more than Peter.
                                   c.     Mary talks more than Peter.
                                   d.     Mary is more talkative than Peter.
                                   e.     Mary bought a more expensive car than Peter.
                                   f.     Mary talks more quickly than Peter.
                             [= Huddleston’s #8]
                                       According to Huddleston, more (which is as a first approximation what I
                             am calling ER) is assigned the following VALUES/FUNCTIONS in each of the previ­
                             ous examples, respectively:
                             (3)      a.       ordinator in a nominal group (NGp)
                                      b.       head in a NGp
                                      c.       head in an adverbial group functioning as an adjunct
                                      d.       modifier of an adjective head
                                      e.       submodifier of an adjective modifier
                                      f.       modifier of an adverb head
                                      I interpret these values/functions roughly as follows:
                             (4)      a.      comparison of the amount of an overt, concrete common noun deno­
                                              tation
                                      b.     comparison of the amount of an abstract common noun denotation
                                      c.     comparison of the extent of a verb phrase denotation, where extent is
                                              understood as frequency, length, duration, intensity, etc.
                                      d.     comparison of the degree of an adjective denotation
                                      e.     comparison of the degree of an adjective denotation or a compound
                                               adjective plus noun denotation8
                                  6 I later claim that non-predicative nouns and most verbs cannot truly be the object of a com­
                             parison in R ice’s terms (the head of a comparison in my terms). Note that the values/functions
                             that Huddleston attributes to ER below (30) are not compatible with non-predicative nouns or
                             most verbs being the head of a comparison.
                                  7Huddleston’s sentences do not include an example in which a prepositional phrase or a whole
                             clause is the object of a comparison, in the way that Price (1990) seems to intend. The following
                             would be examples of these two types o f comparison:
                                  (i) Mary is more inside our circle of friends than Peter / than outside of our circle of friends.
                                  (ii) What I am trying to say is more that I miss you than that I am madly in love with you.
                                  For the most part, I will ignore such types of comparisons for the sake of simplicity, al­
                             though they pose challenges of their own worthy of future research.
                                  8 See Pinkham (1982) for an interesting analysis of compared adjectives in attribute position.

                             graduator/grader itself’ ,12
                                      Others simply refer to the element under discussion here, i.e., the element
                             most closely involved syntactically with ER, as the HEAD of the comparison (e.g.,
                             Bresnan (1973)). This is the term I will use, although we will see in Chapter 4 that
                             the head of a comparison is not always what the traditional analysis claims it to be.
                             This uncertainty necessitates finding the correct correlation between the head, a syn­
                             tactic element, and the COMPARED PROPERTY, a semantic element.
                                      Now recall sentence (1):
                             (1)      Rodrigo is taller than Felipe.
                                      Although a more precise definition of the head of a comparison must wait
                             until Chapter 4 ,1 will assume for the moment that in (1), the head of the compari­
                             son is the adjective tall. Witness the fact that this is the lexical head which serves as
                             a host for the suffix -er, i.e., the (here, bound) morpheme ER.
                                      The compared property in this sentence - tallness/being tall - is fairly
                             straightforward to identify in a sentence like this since tall is the only lexical item
                             around that could possibly contribute towards a predicative scale.

                             3.1.4 The terms of comparison I the contrasts
                                      Stassen (1985, p.24) claims that in addition to a gradable predicate, a com­
                             parison of inequality involves “...two concepts, one of which represents the stan­
                             dard against which the other is measured and found to be unequal.” For the most
                             part, he restricts his discussion to those cases in which both concepts are individu­
                             als, i.e., nominal expressions. They are NP’s in his terms, although I consider
                             them DP’s under the functional head analysis.13 He labels the NP serving as the
                             standard of comparison the STANDARD NP, and he labels the NP being measured

                                  ,z Hence, Rojas Nieto does not allow verbs or non-predicative nouns to function as the gradu­
                             ate element in a comparison (cf. my notion of the head of a comparison).
                                  13 Recall the theoretical assumptions discussed in Chapter 1 regarding such matters.

                             against the standard the COMPAREE NP.
                                      Prytz (1979, p.261) claims that “para establecer una comparaci6n, hacen
                             falta dos elementos distintos, los terminos de la comparaci6n.” (‘In order to estab­
                             lish a comparison, two distinct elements are needed, the terms of the comparison.’).
                             For him, the SEGUNDO TfiRMINO DE LA COMPARACI6N ‘second term of the com­
                             parison’, which I henceforth refer to as simply the SECOND TERM, is usually that
                             which follows the CONJUNCI6n COMPARAHVA ‘comparative conjunction’, such as
                             than in English.'4 When the second term is a nominal expression, it corresponds to
                             Stassen’s Standard NP. In an analogous fashion, Prytz’s equivalent to Stassen’s
                             Comparee NP is, when nominal, the PRIMER TfiRMINO DELA COMPARAQ6N ‘first
                             term of the comparison’, henceforth the FIRST TERM. Note that for Prytz (p.261),
                             the terms of the comparison are “los elementos distintos en que se compara algo,
                             sin consideraci6n a su funci6n gramatical” (‘the elements in which something is
                             compared, without regard to their grammatical function’). That is, the terms of
                             comparison do not need to be nominal in nature.
                                      Thus, in (1), Rodrigo is the Comparee NP or first term, whereas Felipe is
                             the Standard NP or second term. Prytz’s terminology is equipped to describe a sen­
                             tence such as (7) [his #2, p. 265], whereas Stassen’s is not, at least not using the
                             specific terms just discussed (Comparee NP and Standard NP):
                             (7)      Pilar es              mds alt-a que antes.
                                      Pilar be.3sg‘s ER tall-f16 that before
                                      ‘Pilar is taller than before. ’
                                      There is neither a comparee NP, nor a standard NP, but there is both a first
                             term - an understood ahora ‘now’ - and a second term - antes ‘before’. Of course,

                                  14In many cases, the second term is only a subpart of the material following the CONJUNQON
                             COMRVRATTVA, an element which I will discuss in detail below.
                                 15 In Spanish, both ser and estar are most often translated into English as ‘be’, even though
                             they are not interchangeable. I will gloss both as ‘be’ since the distinctions between these two
                             verbs are not relevant to the argumentation of this dissertation.
                                  19 Spanish adjectives in this dissertation should be taken to be singular unless marked as plural
                             by the abbreviation ‘pi’.

                             Stassen’s looser notion of the two concepts involved in a comparison (cf. earlier
                             discussion) is compatible with (7) —these two concepts are just the first and second
                             terms of the comparison, respectively.
                                     The term that Price (1990) uses which often corresponds to Prytz’s second
                             term is the FOCUS OF CONTRAST. In (1), the focus of contrast is Felipe, and in
                             (7), the focus of contrast is antes. Note that in (1) and (7), the first term is distinct
                            from the head of the comparison. Price (1990) refers to such a comparison as a
                            FULL COMPARISON.17
                                     Now consider the following example given by Prytz (his #3, p.263, gloss
                            and translation mine):
                            (8)      Pilar es         m&s alt-a que fuerte.
                                     Pilar be.3sg ER tall-f that strong18
                                     ‘Pilar is more tall than strong. ’
                                     Here, the first term of the comparison is non-distinct from the head of the
                            comparison - alta. In this type of comparison, which Price ( 1990) refers to as a
                            PARTIAL COMPARISON, she does not call the second term of the comparison a focus
                            o f contrast, but rather a FOCUS OF COMPARISON.
                                     Note that in (1), it is plausible that a second, covert copy of the word tall is
                            present structurally,19even though it only surfaces once overtly, since (1) roughly
                            means:
                            (9)      {Rodrigo is taller than Felipe is tall.}
                                     Price uses her label focus of comparison to refer to the copy of the head

                                  17 Some might consider the first term to always be distinct from the head of the comparison
                            by positing that in certain comparisons, such as (8) below, the compared property is pure degree it­
                            self, and hence, none of the overt elements is the head of comparison. I do not conceive of partial
                            comparisons in those terms, but the difference between these two perspectives might really be sim­
                            ply a difference in terminology and not a deep, structural one.
                                 14 Adjectives in Spanish which do not show any overt gender distinction will not be glossed as
                            either masculine or feminine even though they abstracdy must agree in gender with the noun that
                            they modify.
                                    The same can be said for the copula is. Furthermore, I will claim later that the covert adjec­
                            tive tall is modified by a covert degree expression.




                                                                             40

                             found in the second half of the comparison even if it is covert as in (9). For her, a
                             focus of comparison is “the category in the second half of the comparison modified
                             by an (inferable) quantifier, corresponding to an overtly quantified category in the
                             matrix,” (p.22), in other words, a category in the second half of the comparison
                             corresponding to the head of the comparison.
                                      Prytz (1979), in contrast, would apparently not consider such an element a
                             second term at all, since even though he gives no rigorous definition of SEGUNDO
                             TfiRMINO,   the second term is always an overt element in all of his examples. In
                             fact, Price’s label is problematic - it is somewhat odd to refer to a covert element as
                             a focus, given that a focus is an element that bears new information and receives
                             focal stress (or is contrastive and bears contrastive stress).
                                     I will adopt the English translations of Prytz’s TfiRMINOS DE LA COMPARA-
                             CldN —i.e., the first term and the second term of comparison, since they apply most
                             generally (Stassen’s terms are limited to nominal terms of comparison) and most
                             consistently (Price’s terms vary according to whether or not the head of the compar­
                             ison is distinct from the first term of comparison). I will, however, follow Price’s
                             distinction between full comparisons and partial comparisons, a move which I will
                             justify briefly at the end of this section and more so in the course of the dissertation.
                             In addition, I will give a special label to the type of second term that in a partial
                             comparison is equivalent to the previously defined head of the comparison - 1 will
                             call it the SECOND HEAD. I must first make a modification in Prytz’s terminology
                             and introduce some additional terms.
                                      Sometimes there is not just one pair of contrasts in a comparison but rather,
                             two or even more. Consider the following case:
                             (10)    Jose left more books on the floor than Pedro did on the bed.
                                      In (10), there are two contrasts. The first contrast is between the agentive
                             DP’s Jose and Pedro. That is, there is a contrast between the quantity of books
                             Josd left somewhere and the quantity of books Pedro left somewhere.




                                                                          41

                                      Similarly, there is a contrast between the locative PP’s, on the floor and on
                             the bed. Some books were left on the floor, whereas others were left on the bed.
                                      If we call Jose and Pedro the first and second terms of comparison, respec­
                             tively, what label should we give to the PP’s on the floor and on the bed ? Or alter­
                             natively, if we consider on the floor and on the bed to be the terms of comparison,
                             what are the DP’s Juan and Pedro ?
                                      Prytz does not discuss cases like this, so it is not clear how he would ac­
                             commodate his terminology for such a case.
                                      As Prytz points out, though, we can paraphrase comparisons like (10) so
                             that the head of the comparison books appears as the head of each of two relative
                             clauses:20
                             (11)     The quantity of books that Juan left on the floor is greater than the quantity
                                             of books that Pedro left on the bed.
                                      This paraphrase has the following two terms: the quantity o f books that
                             Jucm left on the floor and the quantity o f books that Pedro left on the bed. Notice
                             that there are two common elements that may be factored out of each of the terms in
                             a parallel fashion: the quantity o f books and left. That is, the contrast between the
                             two terms lies within a subpart of the terms.
                                      A passive paraphrase of (11) isolates the contrasts into a proper substring
                             within each term:
                             (12)     The quantity of books that was left by Juan on the floor is greater than the
                                             quantity of books that was left by Pedro on the bed.
                                      Even so, it is not clear that the contrasting string in each term is a con­
                             stituent In fact, it is more likely that each PP in (12) acts as a separate contrasting
                             element By the same token, both the agentive DP and the locative PP in each term
                             of (10) each participate in a distinct contrast Therefore, I will refer to each term of
                             a comparison as consisting of N-MANY CONTRASTS, often just one, and I will refer

                                20The head of each of these relative clauses is either books, as I have suggested, or amount,
                             whose complement contains books.




                                                                             42

                             to each contrast as one of n-many contrasts within a given term of a comparison.
                             Note that a term consisting of more than one contrast is not necessarily a con­
                             stituent, nor even a contiguous string.
                                      Returning to (10), we see that the first and second term each contain two
                             contrasts. There is an agentive DP contrast in each term, and there is a locative PP
                             contrast in each term. Although there is more than one contrast, Price (1990)
                             would still consider this to be a full comparison since neither of the two contrasts
                             involves the head of the comparison.
                                      Sometimes when there is more than one contrast in a comparison, one of
                             them does involve the head of the comparison.21 Consider the following example:
                             (13)    Juan bought more shoes than Pedro sold socks.
                                      In (13), there are three contrasts. One is the contrast between the subject
                             DP’s Juan and Pedro. Another is the contrast between the verbs bought and sold.22
                             The third contrast involves the head of comparison itself, which in this sentence is
                             the type of clothes item functioning as a direct object - shoes vs. socks. Since at
                             least one of the contrasts involves the head of the comparison, Price (1990) would
                             consider this to be a partial comparison. In this type of comparison, the second
                             head is that contrast within the second term of comparison which is equivalent to
                             the head of the comparison. This would be socks in (13).
                                     The second term of a comparison, as Prytz defines it, is contained (collec­
                             tively if there is more than one contrast present) within, or is identical to, the entire
                             overt portion of that constituent which serves as a STANDARD OF COMPARISON
                             and which Rijkhoek (1996) refers to as the SECOND ASSOCIATE of the comparison.


                                  21 This assumes that in such comparisons, the head is a lexical element and not merely an ab­
                             stract head denoting semantic degree.
                                  22Tense is not contrastive here, although it certainly could be:
                                  (i) Juan will buy more shoes today than Pedro socks yesterday.
                                  In fact, tense can be the only contrast in some sentences:
                                  (ii) Juan will buy more shoes today than he bought yesterday.
                                  In this example, there are two contrasts: future vs. past, and today vs. yesterday.




                                                                             43

                                 In English, Spanish, and SLQZ, the second associate is conjoined23to roughly what
                                 Rijkhoek refers to as the FIRST ASSOCIATE, i.e., the first left-to-right string in the
                                 sentence that would be an entire proposition on its own if it were not for the pres­
                                 ence of ER.24 I illustrate these terms using the following example:
                                 (14)     Felipe is smarter than Rodrigo realizes.
                                          The first left-to-right string in this sentence that would be an entire proposi­
                                 tion on its own if we were to ignore the presence of the morpheme ER (in this case,
                                 the suffix -er on the adjective smart) is Felipe is smarter The constituent that is con­
                                 joined to it is than Rodrigo realizes. I deviate slightly from Rijkhoek (1996) in that
                                 I use the term second associate to include the conjunction separating the first associ­
                                 ate from the second associate. Note that the second associate includes the second
                                 term of comparison, which in this example consists of the two contrasting elements
                                 Rodrigo and realizes (that Felipe is x smart).25 These two contrasts correspond to
                                 Felipe and smart in the first term of comparison.
                                         The standard of comparison goes by many names in the literature. Prytz
                                 (1979) rejects the use of the traditional term SEGUNDO T^RMINO DE LA COMPARA-
                                 C36N for the standard of comparison.          As we see above, he reserves the term SE-
                                 GUNDO t Er M N O     exclusively for the contrasting elements within the standard of
                                 comparison. He calls the entire standard of comparison the T^RMINO SUBORDINA-
                                 DO DE LA COMPARACI6N            ‘subordinate term of the comparison’.
                                         Price (1990) uses a similar English equivalent, SUBORDINATE CLAUSE OF

                                     23 For now, the reader may take the term conjoined to mean either coordinated or standing in a
                                relationship of matrix and subordinate, but I will show in Chapter 5 that there is no consistent
                                 syntactic difference between traditionally labelled matrix/subordination and coordination structures.
                                     24 In some languages, such as Japanese and Turkish, the second associate appears to be con­
                                joined with or subordinated to an element to the right, at least at S-str.
                                     25It is controversial whether the material shown here in parentheses is present at any syntactic
                                level or if it is merely present in the semantic structure. This is part of a more general issue re­
                                garding the status of null complement anaphora, both in general and specifically in comparative
                                constructions. The interested reader should consult Hankamer and Sag (1976) for a general discus­
                                sion of DEEP vs. SURFACE anaphora and Stiez (e.g., 1990) for a discussion on comparative null
                                complement anaphora

                             THE COMPARISON, to refer to the standard of comparison in those comparatives
                             which she terms SENTENTIAL COMPARATIVES, i.e., those which she claims contain
                             an underlying entire clause as the standard of comparison.
                                     Note that both Prytz’s and Price’s terms assume that the second associate of
                             the comparison is subordinated to the first, as opposed to being coordinated with it.
                             As I stated earlier, the issue of the way in which the second associate is linked to a
                            preceding element is discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
                                     Huddleston (1967) refers to the standard of comparison as the COMPARA­
                            TIVE EXPANSION, the English equivalent to Rojas Nieto’s (1990) Spanish term EX­
                            P A N S E COMPARATIVA.
                                     Many refer to the standard of comparison as the COMPARATIVE CLAUSE,
                             but this is problematic since it is not always an entire clause, at least not on the sur­
                             face:
                             (15)    a.      Felipe is taller than Rodrigo.
                                     b.      Rodrigo is more silly than Mike is.
                                     c.      Felipe bought more books than Mike bought magazines.
                                     In (15a) the standard of comparison is superficially a mere DP, whereas in
                            (15b), the standard of comparison seems to be a clause missing a predicate. The
                            standard of comparison in (15c) seems like an independent, complete clause, but
                            there appears to be some type of covert quantifier or degree adverbial before maga­
                            zines. 26 This can be seen from the fact that magazines cannot be preceded by any
                            overt quantifier when in a comparison such as (15c), whereas an independent
                            clause that looks superficially just like the standard of comparison in (15c) can ap­
                            pear with overt quantifiers before magazines-.
                            (15c’) *Felipe bought more books than Mike bought several / m any / tw o
                                          magazines.
                            (15c”) Mike bought several / many / two magazines.
                                     Comparatives such as (15c) are often referred to in the literature as cases of

                               “ It turns out that there is actually both a covert degree adverbial and a covert quantifier before
                            magazines, as we will see in Chapter 4.




                                                                             45

                             and is hence only missing a quantifier or degree expression.27Comparisons exhibit­
                             ing subdeletion, which I take up in more detail later in this chapter and in Chapter 5,
                             are a subcase of partial comparisons, a larger class of comparisons mentioned
                             above and discussed below, some cases of which are missing constituents other
                             than simply a quantifier and/or degree expression.28

                             3.1.5 The comparative particle
                                      The second associate of the comparison or standard of comparison is con­
                             nected to the first associate by an element internal to the former that goes by various
                             names. Bresnan (1973) and Stassen (1985) refer to it as a COMPARATIVE PARTI­
                             CLE,   which corresponds to Prytz’s (1979) Spanish term PARllCULA
                             COMPARAIWA.

                                      Prytz also uses two other terms to refer to the element connecting the two
                             halves of the comparison. One is the general term PARllCULA SUBORDINANTE
                             ‘subordinating particle’, which just like his term TfiRMINO SUBORDINADO DELA
                             COMPARACI6N,        implies that the standard of comparison is subordinated to the first
                             part of the sentence. Another term that he uses takes a more neutral stance as to
                             whether subordination or coordination is involved - CONJUNCI6N COMPARATIVA
                             ‘comparative conjunction’. Prytz includes Spanish de, que, and como within this
                             category.
                                      Price (1990), on the other hand, only considers que and como to fall within
                             her category of CLAUSE INTRODUCERS, a term which when translated into Spanish
                             is similar to Rojas Nieto’s (1990) term INTRODUCTOR but used to refer to a slightly

                                 27 Some (e.g., Grimshaw (1987)) argue that this clause is not even missing a quantifier or de­
                             gree, although I will argue otherwise.
                                 28 Two types of partial comparisons not considered to be cases of comparative subdeletion as I
                             define it later in this chapter are comparative pseudogapping, such as in (i), and some cases of
                             comparative ellipsis, such as in (ii):
                                  (i) Juan sold more books than Tim did egg cartons.
                                  (ii) Juan sold more books than egg cartons.




                                                                             46

                             different set of elements. For Rojas Nieto, an introductor can be either que or de
                             (she does not address comparisons of equality), although she takes de to be the
                             marked option. In Price’s theory, on the other hand, Spanish de introduces only a
                             phrase rather than a clause, so it is a separate type of element than que and como.
                                      Price also presents some terminology suggested by Anderson (1983). He
                             apparently uses the term LINKS in the same way that Bresnan (1973) and Stassen
                             (1985) use COMPARATIVE PARTICLR For Anderson, a PARTICLE is only an ordi­
                             nary LINK - all it does it connect the first clause of the comparison and the stan­
                             dard of comparison. ADPOSITIONS (i.e., prepositions and postpositions) and
                             CASE-MARKING,        on the other hand, are examples of actual COMPARATIVE MARK­
                             ERS.   A comparative marker is an element which “distinguishes a comparison of in­
                             equality from a comparison of equality” (Anderson (1983), quoted in Price (1990,
                             p.3)). This definition implies that a comparative marker could be something other
                             than the two things mentioned by Anderson - adpositions and case-marking. For
                             example, it could be the comparative particle in the sense of Bresnan (1973) and
                             Stassen (1985) in some cases, such as English than or Spanish que. It could alter­
                             natively be ER itself, or even something like the EXPLETIVE NE that shows up in
                             French comparisons,29as suggested by Price.
                                      In any case, I will use the term COMPARATIVE PARTICLE30 to describe any
                             preposition or clausal conjunction31 which links the first half of a comparison to the
                             standard of comparison. What I call the comparative particle links the first and sec­
                             ond associates of a comparison and is contained within the second associate. As

                                  30 Those elements which I call comparative particles are not particles in the standard usage of
                             the term PARTICLES - i.e., comparative particles are not necessarily prosodically weak, minor sen­
                             tence constituents.
                                  3' I use the term CLAUSAL CONJUNCTION to refer to what are traditionally referred to as coor­
                             dinators and complementizers, and without the adjective clausal, the term CONJUNCTION will in­
                             clude not only coordinators and complementizers but also prepositions (following Rijkhoek
                             (1996)).




                                                                              47

                             we will see in this chapter and in Chapter 5, the comparative particle may occur
                             within a string of various elements that separate the first associate from the second
                             term of the comparison. In such cases, I consider only the first element of the
                             string to be the comparative particle.
                                       In many languages, comparisons cannot be or are not always formed with a
                             comparative particle, but I will restrict my discussion to those comparatives that do
                             involve a comparative particle.32
                                       The choice of comparative particle in those languages which have more than
                             one available is determined by both the type of comparison, i.e., comparison of
                             equality vs. comparison of inequality, as well as the syntactic and semantic nature
                             of the standard of comparison.

                             3.1.6 Types of standards
                                       Huddleston (1967) makes a distinction between EXPLICITLY DEFINED STAN­
                             DARDS     and IMPLICITLY DEFINED STANDARDS. Of the former type, he offers the
                             following examples, claiming that the comparative expansion is a NGp (a nominal
                             group):
                             (16) Mary bought more records than ten.
                             (17) The car was travelling faster than 90 m.p.h.
                             (18) The attacks come as frequently as once a day.
                             [Huddleston’s examples (9)-(ll), underlines mine]
                             In each of these examples, the standard is a numeral or a measure phrase.
                                       On the other hand, he considers all implicitly defined standards to be clausal
                             in nature, even though such a clause “may be realized in surface structure by a sin­
                             gle NGp” (p.92). He takes all of the sentences in (2), repeated here, to involve this
                             type of standard.
                             (2)       a.      Mary bought more records than Peter.
                                       b.      Mary achieved more than Peter.
                                       c.      Mary talks more than Peter.
                                       d.      Mary is more talkative than Peter.
                                 321 refer the interested reader to Stassen (1985) for information on non-particle comparisons.
                             Stassen’s extensive typology encompasses a wide range of languages and constructions.




                                                                             48

                                   e.     Mary bought a more expensive car than Peter.
                                   f.     Mary talks more quickly than Peter.
                             [= Huddleston’s (8)]
                                      Thus, whereas ten is a number of records smaller than the number of
                             records that Mary bought, Peter, in (2a), is not a number of records exceeded by
                             the number that Mary bought, but rather, an individual who also bought some num­
                             ber of records.33 It is the number of records that this second individual bought, in
                             fact, though not mentioned, that is smaller than the number of records that Mary
                             bought.
                                      In a comparison of adjectival degree, such as (9), repeated here and
                             represented schematically in (9’), it is not as clear whether it is a covert degree ad­
                             verbial, representing the degree to which Felipe is tall, rather than the DP Felipe it­
                             self, representing Felipe’s height, which serves as a standard of comparison:
                             (9)      Rodrigo is taller than Felipe is tall.
                             (9’)     {Rodrigo is taller than Felipe is [d tall], J34
                                      [where d is the degree to which Felipe is tall]
                                      If the word Felipe is construed as standing for Felipe’s height, then it is an
                             explicit standard of comparison. Alternatively, if the schema in (9’) is correct, then
                             the standard of comparison is implicit. The fact that English always uses than in
                             comparisons of inequality may obscure evidence favoring a conclusion either that
                             this comparison has an explicit standard or that it has an implicit standard. Other
                             languages, such as Spanish and SLQZ, use a variety of comparative particles, the
                             choice of which often indicates whether a given comparison has an explicit or im­
                             plicit standard. The distribution of comparative particles in these languages is given
                             in §3.4 and analyzed in Chapter 5.




                                  33 As pointed out to me by PamelaMunro (p.c.), this number could be zero.
                                  34 Some may claim that there is not actually any degree (or quantifier) in the position indicated
                             (e.g., Grimshaw (1987)). I show in Chapter 4, however, that there in fact is.

                             3.1.7 Justifying the distinction between full and partial comparisons
                                      Before beginning the next section, I would like to pause here to justify
                             Price’s (1990) distinction between full comparisons and partial comparisons as
                             promised. Recall that in a full comparison, the first term of comparison is distinct
                             from the head of the comparison, whereas the first term of comparison and head are
                             non-distinct in a partial comparison.
                                      Partial comparisons involve the degrees of two distinct, but compatible
                             gradable properties. Therefore, in partial comparison, an overt element correspond­
                             ing to what is traditionally taken to be the head of the comparison,35which is usual­
                             ly the closest syntactic correlate to the compared property, surfaces in the second as­
                             sociate of the comparison, forming a contrast in addition to any others that may also
                             be present. In fact, this element may serve alone as the second term of comparison
                             in some cases, such as (19),36where the pronoun he does not form a contrast,
                             under the interpretation indicated by indexation:
                             (19)     Rodrigoj read more books than hej read m agazines.37
                                      It is not ungrammatical, at least in English, although it is stylistically some­
                             what marked, to repeat the head of the comparison in the second associate:
                             (20)     John snores more than Bill snores.38
                                      Note that, at first glance, it may appear in a sentence like (20) that the com­
                             pared property is the denotation of the verb, here the set of those individuals who

                                  351 m a in ly disagree with this terminology with regard to amount comparisons and in verbal
                             extent comparisons. In the former, I take MUCH, an abstract quantifier, to be the head of the
                             comparison, and in the latter, I take MUCH or a covert extent or frequency adverbial to be the head
                             of the comparison.
                                  38The pronoun he could be stressed contrastively if used deicticly rather than anaphorically, re­
                             ferring to some other individual. In this case, it, too, would serve as a contrast within the second
                             term of the comparison.
                                  37 In my analysis, magazines is not actually the second head. Instead, the covert abstract quan­
                             tifier MUCH which takes magazines as a complement is the second head. For that matter, the first
                             head is also MUCH, not books.
                                  38 I claim that the actual first and second head of an verbal extent comparison such as this are a
                             covert extent adverbial MUCH.




                                                                               50

                             snore. As I discuss in Chapter 4, however, the real compared property in such a
                             comparison is an extent adverbial. This extent adverbial surfaces in disguised form
                             in the first associate, as the abstract MUCH part of more?9- that is, more is, at least
                             in this instance, a complex morphological form containing MUCH, singular agree­
                             ment,'10and ER. This extent adverbial is entirely covert in the second associate.
                             Thus, although Price (1990) would consider the second instance of snores to be a
                             focus of comparison, and although the first instance might be considered by some
                             to be the head of the comparison, the denotation of snores is not actually the com­
                             pared property.41 That seems to be why it is allowed to surface in the second asso­
                             ciate. Any stylistic markedness at all, then, is due to repetition of part of the com­
                             mon ground, a term defined below.
                                      A similar situation arises in an amount comparison such as in (21):
                             (21)     ??John bought more books than Bill bought books.
                             Although the traditionally assumed head of the comparison is books, there is a
                             covert amount expression associated with it containing MUCH which is the actual
                             compared properly. MUCH takes books as its complement The hidden amount
                             expression is composed of this abstract quantifier element MUCH plus plural num­
                             ber agreement, which taken together with ER form the word more. That is, this in­
                             stance of more is composed of many plus ER. It is unexpected for (21) to be so

                                  391 use the teem abstract since MUCH is not transparently a morphological component of
                             more and since a non-comparative sentence would employ a lot much more naturally than much:
                                  (i) ??John snores much.
                                  (li) John snores a lo t
                                  I take MUCH to symbolize an abstract extent adverbial that does not surface alone in post-ver­
                             bal position. It does surface if it modifies a degree expression (iii) or if a degree expression modi­
                             fies it (iv):
                                  (iii) John snores m u ch m o r e than I can take.
                                  (iv) John snores too much.
                                  401 conflate the notions of singular agreement, mass noun agreement, abstract noun agree­
                             ment, and abstract extent agreement. This may prove to be overly simplistic but I will assume
                             this to be unproblematic in this work.
                                  41 In fact, recall that neither Pry tz nor Rojas Nieto considers the morpheme ER contained in
                             more in such an example to definitively modify a verb.




                                                                              51

                             much less acceptable than (20). Perhaps the reason why this is so is that books is a
                             complement to the head of the comparison, even though it is not the head of the
                             comparison, whereas snores in (20) is neither the head of the comparison nor some
                             sort of complement to it
                                     In any case, when the head of the comparison tmly does coincide with the
                             compared property, then it is almost completely ungrammatical (i.e., even worse

                             (22)    ?*John is taller than Bill is taU.
                             (23)    *This story is better than that one is good.

                             (24)    *John runs more quickly than you run quickly.
                                     In fact, if we take MUCH to be the compared property in the following two
                             sentences, we can see that we cannot repeat the syntactic element representing the
                             compared property in the second associate of the comparison here, either:
                             (25)    *John bought more books than I bought many books.
                                           [where more = ER.MUCH.pl42and many = MUCH.pll
                             (26)    *John ran more than I ran (very) much.43
                                           [where more = ER.MUCH and much =MUCH1
                                     We get interesting results if we modify (20)-(24) so that the head of the
                             comparison is not repeated in the second associate of the comparison, but rather, is
                            paralleled by a distinct lexical item:
                             (20’) John snores more than Bill sneezes.
                             (21 ’) John bought more books than Bill bought records.

                                  421 will gloss more as ERMUCH.pl in amount comparisons involving count nouns, whereas
                            I will gloss more as ERMUCH in amount comparisons involving mass nouns, abstract nouns, or
                            extent adverbials —1 omit marking singular agreement to save space. In the case of adjectival or
                            adverbial comparisons, I will gloss more as simply ER. The reasons for these choices will be­
                            come clear in the analysis of more and ER that I give in Chapter 4.
                                  43 It is true that the ungrammaticality of (26) might be partially due to the fact that in general,
                            a lot is a more natural post-VP extent adverbial in English than much. Nevertheless, (26) would
                            still be out even if we were to take a lot to be the syntactic manifestation of the compared property
                            instead of m uch:
                                  (i) *John ran more (=a lot + ER) than 1 ran a lot.

                             (24’) John runs more quickly than you run elegantly.
                                      We see in (20’), (21’) and (24) that creating an additional contrast in the sec­
                             ond term improves the acceptability of the sentence (cf. (20), (21) and (24)). At
                             first glance, it appears that this type of modification does not help much in the case
                             of an adjectival head of comparison (22’) and (23’). However, usage of more in­
                             stead of the suffix -er accomplishes the improvement that we were seeking:
                             (22”) John is more tall than Bill is fat.
                             (23 ’) a.     ?*This story is more good than that one is well-known.
                                    b.     TThis story is more interesting than that one is well-known.
                                    c.     This story is more scary than that one is funny.44
                                     There seems to be some idiosyncratic variation among adjectives with re­
                             spect to their abililty to appear in a partial comparison. This variation depends on
                             several factors, such as semantic parallelism/compatibility between the two adjec­
                             tives used and whether or not the comparative form of each one is suppletive or reg­
                             ular.
                                     Nevertheless, we see from the preceding data that in a partial comparison, a
                             compared adjective is often preceded by more instead being suffixed with ER, even
                             in the case of adjectives that in full comparisons undergo -er suffixation rather than
                             being preceded by more. I do pause here to note, though, that a major implication
                             of such a pattern is that the use of more may indicate a looser syntactic relationship
                             in a specific case between what I have termed the head of the comparison and ER,
                             and in an analogous manner, a looser semantic relationship between the denotation
                             of the head of the comparison and the compared property. That is, the use of more
                             instead of -er may indicate in certain instances that ER is taking scope over an entire
                             VP or clause rather than just over a simple lexical head.
                                     As we have just seen, material in the second associate that is identical to ma­
                             terial in the first associate tends to be null (whether base-generated that way or

                             deleted). Take (27) for example:
                             (27)    Josd is more grouchy on Mondays than Juan (is).
                                     According to the terminology I have laid out, Juan is the second term of the
                             comparison —it contrasts with the matrix subject Jose. The copula is is optionally
                             absent in the second associate. The adjective grouchy, which is the head of the
                             comparison, is covert in the second associate of the comparison. Therefore, this is
                            a full comparison.
                                     Prytz (1979) uses the term fondo comiin to refer to the material which is
                             common to both the first and second associate, other than the head of the compari­
                            son, whether overt or covert in the second associate. The best English translation
                            of Prytz’s Spanish term may be common ground, and this is how I will refer to this
                            notion in the course of the dissertation.45
                                     In (27), the common ground is the time adverbial on Mondays* The adjec­
                            tive grouchy represents the property measured in both associates of the comparison,
                            but according to Prytz, this is not part of the common ground. Semantically, it rep­
                            resents the RASGO COMPARADO ‘compared feature’, but syntactically, it is the head
                            of the comparison, according to the terminology I am adopting.
                                     If only the time adverbial differs (28), or if both the subject and time adver­
                            bial differ (29), the comparison remains a full comparison, both according to
                            Price’s definition and as evidenced by syntactic properties discussed below.
                            (28)     Josd is more grouchy on Mondays than (he is) on Tuesdays.
                            (29)     Josd is more grouchy on Mondays than Pedro is on Tuesdays.
                                     The common ground in (28) is Jose, whereas in (29), there is no common
                             ground at all.

                                 45 For the sake o f simplicity, I do not mention tense as part of the common ground even when
                            there is no tense contrast between the two terms of the comparison.
                                 48 Prytz does not take functional elements such as the copula es ‘is’ to be part of the common
                            ground. I sometimes take it to be so in order to simplify the diagnostic operation discussed below,
                            since I believe that nothing important in this diagnostic test hinges on whether or not it is part of
                            the common ground.




                                                                             54

                                     In some way left to be refined in Chapter 4, being grouchy alone (cf. (29)),
                             rather than a more complex property composed of being grouchy plus another ele­
                             ment of the sentence, such as being grouchy on day X of the week (cf. (27)), or
                             person Y being grouchy (cf. (28)), is the property whose degree is represented syn­
                             tactically by that constituent which is most directly tied to ER, i.e., the compared
                             property, even if there is a common ground between the two associates of the com­
                            parison. Despite the fact that various elements may be covert along with the ele­
                            ment equivalent to the head that is understood in the second associate, any of them
                            may surface, especially if contrastive, without changing various syntactic properties
                            to be discussed below. Whether they are overt or covert does not affect whether or
                            not the comparison is classified as full or partial.
                                     On the other hand, if another property parallel to grouchiness/being grouchy
                            is realized overtly in the second term of comparison, i.e., if there is a second (usu­
                            ally distinct) head, then the comparison is classified as a partial comparison, regard­
                            less of how many or few other contrasts are present:
                            (30)    Josd is   more grouchy on Mondays than (he is) sleepy.
                            (31)    Josd is   more grouchy on Mondays than (he is) sleepy on Tuesdays.
                            (32)    Josd is   more grouchy on Mondays than Pedro is sleepy (on Mondays).
                            (33)    Josd is   more grouchy on Mondays than Pedro is sleepy on Tuesdays.
                                     The common ground in (30)-(33) is as follows: (30) Jose is.. .on Mondays',
                            (31) Jose is, (32) on Mondays, and (33) no common ground. We already know
                            that Prytz’s definition excludes the head from being considered part of the common
                            ground. Nevertheless, in a full comparison, the head is linked to a property shared
                            by both terms, and one could therefore conceivably prefer to modify Prytz’s termi­
                            nology in order to include the head as part of the common ground. In a partial com­
                            parison, however, the head does not represent a property shared by both terms, un­
                            less one were to refine the notion of head of a comparison. Semantically speaking,
                            Prytz does refer to the compared feature in partial comparisons as being pure degree
                            alone. Note, though, that this compared feature does not match the syntactic head




                                                                          55

                            of the comparison as the latter has been traditionally envisioned.
                                     To claim that (30)-(33), which are partial comparisons, are fundamentally
                            different from (27)-(29), which are full comparisons, assumes that a semantic de­
                            gree is represented by a syntactic constituent which is locally associated with a spe­
                            cific lexical item, namely, what I call the comparative head, rather than being loose­
                            ly related to an entire proposition. If the syntactic constituents denoting degrees
                            were loosely related to an entire proposition, then there should not be a single local-
                            izable element whose overtness or covertness determines whether a comparison is
                            full or partial, a distinction which I claim bears syntactic and semantic ramifications.
                            There should be no distinction between a full comparison and a partial comparison,
                            nor any difference between a second head and any other contrast in the second term
                            of comparison.
                                     There is, however, such an element which is treated distinctly from other
                            contrasts in the literature (e.g., Price (1990)) - the second head. Constituents in the
                            second associate other than second head may be covert or overt - they are usually
                            covert unless they form a contrast with some element in the first associate - without
                            changing the classification of the comparison, according to Price’s (1990) terminol­
                            ogy, from that of full comparison to partial comparison. In contrast, if the second
                            head surfaces overtly, then the comparison is classified as a partial comparison, no
                            matter what the behavior of the other constituents is.
                                     Sdez (1993) makes a distinction that more or less correlates with the full
                            comparison vs. partial comparison distinction. He discusses Keenan’s (1987)
                            claims about sentences like the following:
                            (33)     More students than teachers are vegetarians.
                                     Keenan claims that (33) contains a conservative47two-place determiner
                            more-than, a claim which Sdez accepts as correct. S4ez distinguishes between this

                                      In most cases, wherever Sdez proposes the presence of mas-quey, the sen­
                             tence would be considered by Price to be a full comparison. Similarly, most cases
                             of mas-que2 corresponds to cases of partial comparisons, some of which are cases
                             of comparative subdeletion. The distinction between mas-quey and mas-que2 corre­
                             sponds to a semantic difference (a one-place determiner vs. a two-place determiner)

                                     Essentially what this test shows is that a full comparison only contains one
                             overt instance of the head, whereas a partial comparison contains one head in the
                             first associate and a second head in the second associate. This is, one again, related
                             to the motivation for the term comparative subdeletion, in that in this subcase of
                             partial comparisons, all that is missing from the second associate is a quantifier or a
                             degree adverbial - no lexical arguments or predicates are missing.
                                     If the head of the comparison is an argument of the matrix predicate, then
                             removing the head from the first associate will result in ungrammaticality except in
                             the case of partial comparisons. This follows from the fact that a partial comparison
                             in which the head is an argument contains a compatible element in the second term,
                             namely the second head, able to satisfy one of the matrix predicate’s theta roles after
                             the reduction operation in the same way that the formerly present head of the com­
                             parison did.
                                     If the head of the comparison is the matrix predicate itself, then the reduced
                             sentence will be incomplete unless the second associate contains a compatible sub­
                             stitute, i.e., there must be a second head. This is only the case in a partial




                                                                          59

                                     If the head of a comparison is an adjunct, then the reduction of the original
                            sentence as described above will not create ungrammaticality, even in the case of
                            full comparison, because the presence or absence of a given adjunct does not affect
                            whether a proposition is complete (although a given sentence without a given ad­
                            junct has a different interpretation than the same sentence with that adjunct):

                                     Note that even though (50)-(52) are grammatical, the lack of adjunct does
                            reflect a loss of information from the original sentence, beyond the type of loss that
                            all of these sentences undergo in this reduction operation, i.e., the loss of compari­
                            son. Thus, the overall pattern, despite the complication mentioned here, does serve
                            to distinguish most cases of partial vs. full comparisons.
                                     A controversial case of whether a comparison is full or partial occurs when
                            there is no overt second head and yet some element corresponding to the head’s
                            complement or an adjunct within its maximal projection is paralleled in the second
                            associate by a non-identical element (cf. (55), (56), (58), (66), and (67) below).
                            The following consists of a reduction paradigm, both with and without overt sec­
                            ond heads, for the adjective proud, which may take a source argument, and a reduc­
                            tion paradigm for the noun girls, which may be modified by a source adjunct:

                                     Note that repeating the head of a comparison, as in (54), (57), and (65), in­
                             duces a comparison to behave like a partial comparison as far as the reduction test is
                             concerned, whereas the same sentences with no overt repetition of the head behave
                             like full comparisons (cf. (55) and (56), (58), and (66) and (67), respectively).
                             Sdez reports examples like (65) as involving mas-quej, which is what we would
                             expect based on the correlation that we observed above between mas-quej and full
                             comparisons. Prytz, on the other hand, reports a similar example but considers the
                             understood but null repeated head to be part of the second term:
                             (68)    Juan escribe          mds          cartas aburrid-a-s que interesante-s.
                                     Juan write.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl letters boring-f-pl that interesting-pl
                                     ‘Juan writes more boring letters than interesting ones.’ [=Prytz’s #14]
                                     [Prytz: 1st term = cartas aburridas, 2nd term = cartas interesantes]
                                     The reduction test indicates that full comparison is at work, at least in
                             Spanish:
                             (68’)   *Juan escribe mds carta3-aburridas -que interesantes.
                                     [1st term = (?cartas) aburridas, head = cartas]
                                     The reduction test gives a somewhat unclear result in English:
                             (68” ) Juan writes moreboring-lctters-thaa interesting ones.
                                    [1st term = boring (?letters), head = letters]
                                     The reduced sentence in (68”) is grammatical (although there must be an an­
                             tecedent available for the pro-form ones in the discourse context for (68”) to denote
                             clearly). Thus, one might consider the English example to involve partial compari­
                             son. Of course, if our criterion of felicitousness were whether or not the remaining
                             string forms a sentence capable of standing on its own without requiring any an­
                             tecedents provided in the discourse context, then (68”) would prove to be a full
                             comparison in English as well.
                                     Since two different languages can behave differently with respect to a syn­
                             tactic test for more or less the same sentence, it is possible that the reduction test
                             only reveals superficial syntactic differences. Nevertheless, I will continue to em-




                                                                          63

                             3.1.8 Summary of fundamental nomenclature
                             1)      A comparison of the type surveyed in this dissertation is divided into two
                                          halves: a FIRST ASSOCIATE and a SECOND ASSOCIATE, which are
                                          linked to one another by a COMPARATIVE PARTICLE

                             2)      The second associate is or contains a STANDARD OF COMPARISON.
                             3)      A comparison involves at least one CONTRAST between the first associate
                                          and the second associate but may involve several. All of the elements
                                          in the first associate which, individually, form contrasts with corre­
                                          sponding elements in the second associate are called, collectively, the
                                          FIRST TERM OF COMPARISON. The corresponding elements in the
                                          second associate together form the SECOND TERM OF COMPARISON,
                                          which is the actual standard of comparison.
                             4)      Comparisons of inequality are marked by a special morpheme, represented
                                          abstractly as ER, whereas comparisons of equality involve a special
                                          morpheme termed EG.
                             5)      There is usually one lexical item more closely tied syntactically to ER (or
                                            EG) than any other in the comparative sentence. It is referred to as
                                            the HEAD OF THE COMPARISON. If it is mirrored by a compatible el­
                                            ement in the second associate, in a partial comparison, this second el­
                                            ement is referred to as the SECOND HEAD (cf. Price’s term FOCUS OF
                                            COMPARISON).

                             6)      A comparison is employed to show that some property, which I term the
                                          COMPARED PROPERTY, is held either equally or unequally by two
                                          entities, the first and second terms of the comparison. The compared
                                          property is often the denotation of the head of the comparison, per­
                                          haps always so if the definition of the head is adjusted properly.

                             3.2 Characteristics of the comparative morpheme ER
                                       Here I present the distribution of the comparative morpheme ER and make
                             some preliminary observations regarding its morphological, syntactic, and semantic
                             nature.
                             3.2.1 Distribution of ER
                                       First, I review the distribution of the comparative marker ER in English, in
                             order to orient readers in a language familiar to the largest readership, and then I
                             move on to Spanish and San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec.

                             3.2.1.1 English
                                       As we saw in §3.1, there are many types of heads with which the mor­
                             pheme ER may interact in a comparison. In English, ER manifests itself in appar­
                             ently one of two ways. First, it may surface in certain synthetic50comparatives as
                             the suffix -er, hence the label ER, on the comparative form of almost any monosyl­
                             labic adjective51 (70), some disyllabic adjectives (71), and some adverbs not formed

                                   “ The term SYNTHETIC INFLECTION refers to a type of inflection in which an inflectional
                             morpheme is bound and is affixed to the lexical morpheme that it modifies. Such inflection may
                             take place in either the lexicon or in the syntax, depending on one’s theoretical assumptions. AN­
                             ALYTIC INFLECTION, on the other hand, refers to a type of inflection in which an inflectional
                             morpheme is free and is syntactically independent from the lexical morpheme that it modifies.
                                   51 One systematic exception is the case of participial adjectives: e.g., more pleased vs.
                             *pleaseder. This may be due to the partially verbal nature of participles.
                                   Also, in cases of comparative ellipsis involving either partial comparisons, such as in (i), or
                             so-called epistemic or metalinguistic comparison (McCawley (1988) and Napoli (1983)), as in (ii),
                             even amonosyllabic adjective cannot be suffixed with -er.
                                   (i) Pedro is more sly than poor, so he always manages to feed himself and his family.
                                   (i ’) *Pedro is slier than poor, so he always manages to feed himself and his family.
                                   In (i), Pedro is both sly and poor, but he is more sly. Comparative subdeletion in general will
                             be explained later in this chapter.
                                   (ii) Mary is more calm than shy.
                                   (ii’) *Mary is calmer than shy.
                                   In (ii), even though Mary may seem shy, it is really more the case that Mary is just calm than
                             it is the case that she is actually shy. In epistemic / metalinguistic comparisons such as this, the
                             extent to which each of two entire propositions is true is at stake. The two propositions being
                             compared in (ii) are (iii) and (iv):
                                   (iii) Mary is calm.
                                   (iv) Mary is shy.




                                                                              65

                             curs in analytic comparatives in what I claim is a different version of the word
                             more, which I will claim is just an alternative form of ER in the case of the follow­
                             ing types of adjectival and manner adverbial comparisons.53 It occurs before many
                             disyllabic adjectives (some of which also allow-er suffixation as an alternative)54
                             (75), before polysyllabic adjectives (76), and before most types of adverbs (77):

                                  521 thank Dominique Sportiche for pointing out (p.c.) that one might consider the word more
                             to be a synthetic comparative of expressions of amount or degree, such as a lot, much, many, and
                             very. I do consider this to sometimes be the case but only in comparisons o f amount or verbal ex­
                             tent This issue involves looking very closely at what the compared property is in various cases,
                             reconsidering the identity of the head, and making decisions about the structures involved.

                                     b.       Abraham visits me more often than I visit him.
                                      Note that there is an odd asymmetry here with respect to the relative word
                             order between more and the element traditionally considered to be the head of the
                             comparison: more occurs before nouns (comparison of amounts) and before adjec­
                             tives and adverbs (comparison of degree) but after verb phrases (comparison of ex­
                             tent or frequency). An analysis of this asymmetry is presented in Chapter 4.
                                     Spanish, which we turn to next, exhibits an analogous split behavior with
                             regards to the positioning of mas.

                             3.2.1.2 Spanish
                                     With very few exceptions, Spanish adjectival and adverbial comparatives
                             are analytic. The few synthetic adjectival and adverbial comparatives that there are
                             in Spanish are historical remnants of Latin synthetic comparatives (and suppletives
                             at that) as shown in Table 3.1. Note the string -or, a historical remnant of the Latin
                             comparative suffix -or, akin to the English -er.
                            Table 3.1 Synthetic com paratives in Spanish (non-productive)ss

                                     In productive Spanish morphology, ER is manfested analytically in adjecti­
                             val and adverbial comparatives, in the form of mas, preceding the adjective (78) or
                             adverbs (79) serving as the head of the comparison:

                                               ‘Your friends are more apathetic than Eduardo’s ’
                                  “ The gloss of a definite article in Spanish will only include number if the definite article is
                             plural. Otherwise, it should be assumed that the definite article is singular.
                                  57The word que has many functions in Spanish, the most common of which is as a comple­
                             mentizer, akin to English that. Therefore, I will gloss it as ‘that’ throughout, even when the
                             translation of a sentence with que requires the word than.
                                  “ The morphology of Spanish possessive adjectives works in the following way. The posses­
                             sor determines the lexical stem, and the possessee (the possessed object or person) determines num­
                             ber (always marked by the suffix -s) and in the case of the lpl stem, gender agreement (marked by
                             either the suffix -o or the suffix -a to indicate grammatical masculinity or femininity, respectively,
                             of the possessee). The possessor-determined stems in Latin American Spanish are as follows
                             (Castilian Spanish uses a grammatically second-person plural pronoun and related possessive
                             forms, but these forms do not appear in this dissertation, so 1 will omit them in this chart):
                                               lsg                 2sg             3sg               lpl             3pl
                                                mi                  tu             su              nuestr-           su
                                  Bear in mind that there are two grammatically third-person pronouns in Spanish which are se­
                             mantically second-person: Ud. ‘you (singular, polite)’ and Uds ‘you (plural, polite or informal in
                             Latin American Spanish)’. None of the data in this dissertation pertains to the form Ud, so all in­
                             stances of the singular, informal second-person pronoun and related grammatical forms will simply
                             be referred to as ‘2 sg \ and all instances of Uds. and related forms will be referred to as ‘3pl’.
                                  Having explained these details, I now present the notation I will use specifically for the gloss­
                             es of possessive adjectives:
                                  T h e ls g and 2sg stem s
                                  (i) person and number of possessor, followed by the abbreviation ‘poss’, followed by ‘pi’
                             only if the possessee is plural.
                                  T h e lp l stem
                                  (ii) person and number of possessor, followed by the abbreviation ‘poss ’, followed by gender
                             of possessee, followed by ‘pi’ only if the possessee is plural.

                             possessee is plural.

                                      Spanish mas, just like English more, displays an asymmetry with respect to
                             positioning: it comes before nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, but after verbs.
                             Interestingly enough, San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec does not exhibit this dichoto-
                             mous behavior.

                             3.2.1.3 San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec (SLQZ)
                                      San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec, henceforth SLQZ, has both synthetic and ana­
                             lytic comparatives, and they are in free variation.64 The ER morpheme almost al­




                                  83 The abbreviation ‘refl’ stands for a reflexive pronoun, not always literally translatable into
                             English.
                                  841 have only come across a few rare instances where either synthetic or analytic comparatives
                             are allowed to the exclusion of the other One example is when the orientation (positive or nega­
                             tive) associated with the morpheme ER needs to receive contrastive stress (i.e., MORE, not
                             LESS), in which case the analytic form must be used.




                                                                              70

                            ways surfaces as -ru’. 65 This suffix may surface attached to maaz,66a morpheme
                            borrowed from Spanish mds which in most SLQZ comparisons appears to have no
                            interpretative contribution of its own.®7It can equally well attach directly to any
                            predicate, whether it be an adjective (82)-(84), an adverb (85), a verb (86), or a
                            predicate nominal (87). In each example, (a) is the synthetic variant, and (b) is the
                            analytic variant
                            Adjectives

                                 85As shown below, comparisons such as ‘more than five’do not involve -ru’. Furthermore,
                            the morpheme -ru' is not restricted to comparative constructions but may also be used with other
                            meanings, such as ‘still’ (i), ‘else’ (ii), or ‘longer’ (as in ‘not any longer’) (iii) [although I gloss
                            all of these instances as ER to be consistent]:
                                  (i) Tu        r-a’ihsy-ru’ re:e’ ?
                                        who hab-sleep-ER here
                                        ‘Who still sleeps here ?’
                                  (ii)    Xi-m’ b-da’uhw Rrodriiegw
                                        what-ER perf-eat        Rodrigo
                                        ‘What else did Rodrigo eat ?’
                                  (iii) Tu cei’ty-ru’ r-a’ihsy re:e’ ?
                                        who neg-ER hab-sleep here
                                        ‘Who no longer sleeps here ?’
                                 88This morpheme often surfaces as maa instead. This variation is free when the morpheme is
                            used with the suffix -ru’, but only the full form is allowed when used with the suffix -to' (which
                            PamelaMunro (p.c.) claims is the same emphatic element which sometimes means ‘too’). The
                            SLQZ word mahs ‘even though’, which is also derived from Spanish mds (Munro, Lopez, et al (in
                            preparation)), is an independent morpheme, in contrast with the word maaz in its various allo-
                            morphs.
                                  87 Thus maa(z) is a dummy head in most cases. However, it apparently maintains some of the
                            comparative force found in its source, the Spanish word mds, in comparatives of the type ‘more
                            than [cardinal number]’ since ru’ (i.e., ER) does not surface in such sentences. I leave this open
                            for future research.
                                  88Recall from Chapter 2 that there is more than one copular verb in SLQZ. Each adjective is
                            associated with a given copula, although some adjectives cannot cooccur with a copula in the neu­
                            tral aspect.
                                  891 gloss SLQZ cah as ‘than’ since its only apparent use is as a comparative particle.

                            nominal, that is, the string ER plus nominal does not surface in SLQZ:70

                                 70 It follows from my claim that English more and Spanish mds contain more than just ER,
                            that neither English nor Spanish allows simply ER plus (non-predicative) nominal, either.

                                  71 There is a very interesting mechanism for forming SLQZ verbs from Spanish infinitives or

                             phonological modifications. The borrowed Spanish lexical item is inserted after the subject, itself
                             preceded by the SLQZ verb ruhnny ‘do/make’, used in the appropriate aspect.
                                  Although the second element of all of these expressions formed with ruhnny is separated from
                             the verb by the subject, these expressions should nevertheless be considered to be idiom chunks
                             since the second element cannot be extracted, modified, pronominalized, etc., at least in the data
                             collected thus far
                                  In (89), gann is areduced form of the Spanish noun gana, presumably having an earlier mean­
                             ing ‘gain’, related to the Spanish verb ganar ‘to earn, gain’.




                                                                             73

                             3.2.2 The Nature of ER

                                      Here I propose a general picture of the type of element ER is by suggesting
                             how it relates to cardinal quantifiers, adverbial degree expressions, and predicates.
                                      The element ER is an essential component of comparisons of inequality, and
                             yet its morphosyntactic nature is not clearly understood. An analysis of its semantic
                             properties, introduced here and elaborated in Chapter 4, helps to elucidate its other
                             properties.

                             3.2.2.1 ER vs. quantifiers

                                      The morpheme ER is not a quantifier.72 It does not behave morphosyntacti-
                             cally or semantically in the same way as elements assumed to be quantifiers do,
                             such as existential quantifiers (100), universal quantifiers (101), and cardinal quan­
                             tifiers (102):
                             (100) Juan bought some books.
                             (101) Juan bought every book.
                             (102) Juan bought three books.
                                      Unlike the quantifiers immediately above, ER must cooccur with a second
                             associate (often superficially non-adjacent), introduced by a comparative particle, in
                             order to have complete meaning (103)-(104).

                                  72 Although note that Corver (1993) refers to more as a quantifier.
                                  73 The word de has many functions in Spanish, one of which is to introduce a numerical stan­
                             dard of comparison, but I will gloss i t simply as ‘of ’ in order to be consistent with its most gener­
                             al usage. An analysis of the use of de in comparatives is given in Chapter 5.

                                  74 Comparatives such as this, in which there is no instance of ru', suggest that the word
                             maaz can in at least some instances bear the meaning of ER.
                                  75 The suffix -da’ belongs to the class of comparative particles by the definition given earlier
                             in this chapter The allomorphs that I have observed for da' in the type of comparative construc­
                             tion at hand are: deh, da, ta’ , and da'. PamelaMunro suggests (p.c.) that maazta' and its allo­
                             morphs are derived from Spanish mds de.
                                  78 I justify this gloss in Chapter 4.
                                  77 The morpheme s-, which Munro, L6pez et al. (in preparation) claim is in fact the definite
                             aspect marker, can be prefixed to some quantifiers to indicate ‘more’ but in the sense of ‘addition­
                             al’. It cannot, however, be prefixed to zyezeiny ‘many’, for example, which allows the suffix -ru’
                             for both meanings of ‘more’. In the sentence at hand, though, attaching -ru' to a quantifier like
                             du.u’zh ‘(a) few’ [composed of NEG plus MUCH - cf. Chapter 4] would m ean‘less’/ ’fewer’ rather
                             than ‘a few more’.

                            not need any such embedded constituent to complement its meaning (108) - (109).

                                    Notice that the larger, superficially discontinuous constituent [ER.. .embed­
                            ded constituent] does appear, as a unit, to have the same type of denotation as cardi­
                            nal quantifiers in the case of amount comparisons. However, since I claim in
                            Chapter 4 a unified analysis of amount and degree comparisons, I will discard from
                            the outset the analysis for the constituent [ER... embedded constituent] in which it is
                            a quantifier in order to consider an analysis in which this constituent acts as a de­
                            gree expression instead. I turn to this conceptualization next.

                             exactly as other Degs do. Just like quantifiers may occur with a noun without the
                             need of an additional constituent to complete their meaning, there are Deg’s which
                             may modify a property without the need for an additional constituent (a second as­
                             sociate) to complete their meaning:
                             (110)    I’ve never been this tired before.
                             (111)    How thirsty are you ?
                             (112)    You are so intelligent!
                             (113)    We are very happy to see you.
                                      Unlike these Deg’s, there are others, hypothetically including ER if ER
                             should prove to be a Deg, which require the presence of a second associate to com­
                             plete their meaning.
                             (114)    Juan is taller than Josd.
                             (115)    Juan is as tall as Josd.
                             (116)    Juan is too tall to enter the house through this door.
                             (117)    Juan is tall enough to beat anybody in basketball.
                             (118)    Juan is s o tall that everyone thinks he must be a basketball player.
                                      Without the second associate, these sentences seem incomplete in the ab­
                             sence of an appropriate context
                             (114’)   ?Juan is taller.
                             (115’)   ?*Juan is as tall.
                             (116’)   Juan is too tall.
                             (117’)   Juan is tall enough.
                             (118’)   ?*Juan is so tall.
                                      (114’) is only grammatical if some standard of comparison has already been
                            mentioned in the discourse or if the standard of comparison is understood to be
                             some earlier point in time. That is, (114’) would be a reasonable answer to a choice
                             question such as (119) or a general question such as (120):


                               78 Rijkhoek (in progress) believes this, for example. This issue is discussed in more detail in
                            Chapter 4. Instead of using the traditional term DEGREE ADVERBIAL, I will refer to apparently
                            monomorphematic degree adverbials as Deg’s and more complex degree adverbials as DEGREE EX­
                            PRESSIONS.




                                                                            78

                             (119) Q:          Between Juan and Jose, who is taller ?
                             (120) Q:          Do you notice anything different about any of us since last time you
                                                   saw us ?
                                       (115’) is only marginally grammatical, even if some standard of comparison
                             has already been mentioned in the discourse.
                                       (116’) is grammatical but without context is understood in a general sense -
                             Juan is taller than what is allowed or what is desired. The second associate in (116)
                             designates a specific purpose which Juan is unable to fulfill due to his height.
                                       Similarly, (117’) is fine as it stands but without context merely expresses
                             that Juan is adequately tall for general purposes. Only with a second associate as in
                             (117) does the listener know a specific goal which Juan may fulfill due to his
                             height.
                                       Lastly, (118’) sounds very odd without an exclamative intonation. With ex-
                             clamative intonation, so is more of an intensifies similar to very, rather than point­
                             ing to a consequence of Juan’s height, as in (118).
                                       Not only do the Deg’s in (114)-(118) subcategorize for second associates
                             more or less obligatorily, such second associates may not surface in the absence of
                             the related Deg’s:80
                             (114”) *Juan is tall than Josd.
                             (115”) *Juan is tall as Josd.
                             (116”) *Juan is tall to enter the house through this door.
                             (117”) *Juan is tall to beat anybody in basketball.
                             (118”) *Juan is tall that everyone thinks he must be a basketball player.
                                       Hence, ER, too, enough, and resultative so are not independent degree ad­
                             verbials in the same sense as very, this, that, and how. Nevertheless, it is reason­
                             able to propose that each of these elements together with its second associate does
                             behave as a degree expression. I discuss this in §3.2.2.3.


                                  “ In some languages such as Hebrew, Japanese, and Turkish, the morpheme ER is either op­
                             tionally or obligatorily covert, but I assume that in such instances it is nevertheless present since
                             the equivalent to the other Deg’s under discussion here are required to surface overtly in their re­
                             spective degree constructions in order to license the presence of the second associate.




                                                                               79

                            3.2.2.3 ER as part of a degree expression
                                     Not only is there a syntactic relation of cooccurrence between the Deg’s dis­
                             cussed in the previous section and the corresponding second associates, there is
                            also a logical sense in which the superficially discontinuous81constituent consisting
                             of a Deg and a second associate behave as a degree expression collectively.
                             Compare the degree expressions in (114)-(118) with the Deg’s in (110)-(113), re­
                            peated here:
                            (110)    I’ve never been this tired before.
                            (111)    How thirsty are you ?
                            (112)    You are so intelligent!
                            (113)    We are very happy to see you.
                                     I will thus take ER to be part of a larger constituent which, taken as a
                            whole, denotes a semantic degree located to the right of some other degree on the
                            relevant scale. This latter, lesser degree, if present in the syntactic structure,82
                            would have to be represented by a syntactic element within the larger constituent in­
                            cluding ER signifying the former, higher degree.
                                     This is schematicized in the following examples. The degree to which the
                            books that Juan bought “are many” is [ER than Josd], i.e., more than the degree to
                            which the books that Josd bought “are many”. The degree to which Juan is tall is
                            also [ER than Josd] but is understood here as more than the degree to which Jose is
                            tall. The semantic degree in question in (121) and (122), respectively, lies to the
                            right of the semantic degree to which the books that Jose bought “are many” and the
                            degree to which Jos6 is tall, respectively:



                                 " In the case of enough, there is only a discontinuity between the Deg and the second associate
                            when the property at stake is the quantity of a noun type:
                                 (i) Juan bought en o u g h books to fill ten bookshelves.
                                 In Chapter 4 ,1 mention a rule of ENOUGH PERMUTATION that the investigators discussed there
                            must all assume under one title or another The variants of this rule either move enough to the
                            right of an adjective which it modifies, or move the adjective to the left of enough. The latter vari­
                            ant is the only one acceptable under the theoretical assumptions of Chapter 1.
                                 42 Dominique Sportiche suggests (p.c.) that it is in fact not present in the structure.




                                                                             80

                                     (121) Juan bought more books than Jos6.
                                           Juan bought [ [ER than Jos6 ] many ] books.83
                                           [ER than Jos6 = more than the books that Jos6 bought are many]
                                     (122) Juan is taller than Josd.
                                           Juan is [[ER than Jos6] tall]
                                           [ER than Jos6 = more than the degree to which Jos6 is tall]
                                     It may seem odd to say that the degree to which the books that Juan bought
                            “are many” rather than just saying that the quantity of books that Juan bought is
                            great or large or even just that Juan bought a great/large quantity of books. As a
                            general idea of what motivates the phrasing that I have chosen, I note that such
                            phrasing allows a parallel between amount comparisons and degree comparisons.
                            Amount comparisons are taken to be comparisons involving the degree of quantity
                            and amount in the abstract sense, that is, a degree of the quantifier element in ex­
                            pressions such as how many, so many and too much. In other words, the quanti­
                            fier element MUCH behaves like an adjective for the purposes at hand.84 Such a
                            treatment makes it feasible to claim that all comparisons are comparisons of degree,
                            in each case the degree of an adjectival denotation.
                                     As was discussed above, there are also other elements similar to ER occur­
                            ring within a large constituent which collectively behaves as a degree expression,
                            such as as, too, enough, and resultative so. One might envision the relationship be­
                            tween these degree complexes to simple Deg’s like this, that, and anaphoric so, as
                            analogous to the relationship between the complex consisting of a determiner and a
                            relative clause, on the one hand (123)-(124), and a demonstrative such as this or
                            that or a possessive such as my or Chepo’s that can determine an NP with no rela­
                            tive clause present (125)-(127):

                                “ A more explicit schema showing covert elements is as follows:
                            (i) Juan bought [(ER [than the degree d [to which Jos6 bought d-many books]]]-many) books.
                                MLee (1997) also suggests that such a quantifier (i.e., quantifiers such as many) be treated as a
                            type of adjective. Dominique Sportiche suggests (p.c.) that the predicative use of related words
                            such as numerous also support this notion:
                                (i) Her friends are numerous.

                             3.2.2.4 ER as function or a two-place predicate taking degree arguments
                                      Whatever the syntactic identity of ER may be, it can semantically be consid­
                             ered a function, taking one degree or quantity85as its argument and returning anoth­
                             er degree or quantity further to the right on a linear scale of degrees or quantities.
                             One can also conceive of ER as a two-place predicate carrying the same meaning as
                             the symbol ‘greater than’, >, in mathematics.8®That is, one could consider ER to
                             be a relation between two degrees, analogous to spatial predicates between individ­
                             uals of the type ‘is to the right of ’.
                                      Two-place predicates involve the following type of structure:
                             (128)

                                      YP
                                               X°                 ZP,
                             where YP is the external argument of the predicate in X°, and ZP is its internal argu-

                                  85 It is important to distinguish between the notions of DEGREE, QUANTIFIER, and
                             QUANTITY, although the distinctions are quite subtle. Degrees are operators that take either a grad-
                             able adjective-like property or certain giadable quantifiers, such as the abstract notion of amount or
                             quantity MUCH contained in the English words much or many, as arguments to yield, in the latter
                             case, anon-gradable type of quantifier analogous to cardinal numbers (unless one takes cardinal
                             numbers, too, to be followed by a covert element identical to the abstract many in how many).
                             This non-gradable quantifier is a quantity. For example, an appropriate answer to the question in
                             (i)is(ii):
                                  (i) How many [i.e., degree + gradable quantifier MUCH] chairs do you need ?
                                  (ii) I need four [i.e., quantity, non-gradable quantifier] chairs.
                                  In Chapter 4 , 1 claim that ER always relates one degree to another, with quantity and amount
                             being one type of degree (degree of MUCH).
                                  801 will later claim that comparisons of inferiority contain ER plus a morpheme that serves to
                             reverse the polarity of the scale of comparison. The mathematical analogy would be to multiply
                             everything by -1 so that the number line would be reversed. One manifestation of this inverting
                             morpheme is the English word few (Rivara (1990)).
                                  One could alternatively claim that ER has neither orientation inherently (i.e., it simply means
                             *), and that there must therefore always be an additional morpheme present to indicate positive or
                             negative orientation. This alternative is not supported, at least not transparently, in the morpholo­
                             gy of the languages studied, although it cannot be easily discarded without further studies.

                             ment For example, take the verb kill. Abstracting away from tense, the relevant
                             part of the underlying structure of the proposition in (129) is (130):
                             (129) The murderer killed his accomplice.




                              ie murderer killed                  his accomplice
                                      Hence, if ER is a two-place predicate on degrees, then we might expect the
                             following structure:
                             (131)             CompP.




                                      This structure seems like a reasonable candidate for comparisons such as the
                             following:87
                             (132) The quantity of books that Juan bought surpasses the quantity of books that
                                   Jose bought.
                             (133) The degree to which Juan is tall surpasses the degree to which Jose is tall.
                                      The constructions found in (132) and (133) are both compatible with the
                            presence of what Guti&rez-Rexach (1995) terms DEGREE RELATIVES. In such rel­
                             atives, degrees functioning as arguments of ER are defined via a relativization strat­
                             egy. 88This account is consistent with Kayne’s conception of relative clauses within
                             his 1994 Antisymmetry framework. I explore the notion of degree relatives further
                             in Chapter 5.
                                      Sentences such as (134) and (135) would have (132) and (133), respective­

                                 87 Dominique Sportiche claims (p.c.) that the second degree, i.e., the degree which I claim is
                             denoted by the material in the second associate, is actually left vague and is not truly represented
                             syntactically.

                            ly, as their source under the schema in (131):
                            (134) Juan bought more books than Josd (did).
                            (135) Juan is taller than Josd (is).
                                      Examples such as (132) and (133) are usually confined to mathematics text­
                            books or other technical contexts. We need to explain why such meanings are usu­
                            ally expressed as in (134) and (135), respectively. Notice, too, that the predicate
                            is greater than transparently contains as a subpart the morpheme ER, unless the
                            English word greater is an allomorph of ER. If we take great to be a predicate inde­
                            pendently of ER, then we run into a problem of infinite regress. If one wanted to
                            claim that (132) and (133) are the sources for sentences (134) and (135), one might
                            conceivable take (132) and (133) to have (136) and (137) as their source, respec­
                            tively:
                            (136) The degree to which the quantity of books that Juan bought is great is
                                         greater than the degree to which the quantity of books that Jos6
                                         bought is great.
                            (137) The degree to which the degree to which Juan is tall is great is greater than
                                         the degree to which the degree to which Jos6 is tall is great.
                                      Thus, even if we accept a structure like (131) for ER predication, sentences
                            such as (134) and (135) must be compatible with it without having an underlying
                            structure as in (132) and (133), respectively.
                                      Donati (1997) adopts a predicate analysis for ER but using a structure along
                            the lines of Larson (1988). Whereas Larson proposes VP shells roughly as in
                            (138) for double object constructions, as in (139), Donati proposes a structure with
                            CoP (comparative phrase) shells as in (140) [=her #16] for the Italian sentence
                            (141) [=her #13] containing piu, which I take to be equivalent to ER:

                             to the Co head ER. The preposition di is a dummy element creating the necessary
                             asymmetry between multiple complements dictated by the Antisymmetry framework
                             of Kayne (1994). For Donati, the quantifier in the second term of the comparison
                             (which would be the second associate in my terms) undergoes head-movement to C
                             in order to convert the CP into a QP for the purposes of meeting the selectional re­
                             quirements of piu.
                                     Although Donati’s proposal shows a great deal of promise, there are three
                             problems. First, note that the verb external to CoP, namely mangiato ‘eaten’, se­
                             lects a patient nominal. It is not clear how the verb mangiato could select biscotti,
                             since biscotti is in the specifier of XP, not in X, which is occupied by di. Perhaps
                             verbs can select for CoP’s the way that they can select fro DP’s under the functional
                             head analysis (see Chapters 1 and 4), and Donati’s proposal could very likely over­
                             come this type of objection.
                                     Note, too, that it is not too clear in Donati’s proposal how to accommodate
                             comparisons with explicit standards, such as (142):
                             (142) John bought more than two books.
                                     Perhaps Donati would propose that there is a covert [x many books] in the
                             first argument position of X. This may ultimately prove to be correct, but it is odd
                             that one cannot ever say (143), which should be equally possible under this view:
                             (143) John bought more books than two.
                                     Lastly, as pointed out to me by Dominique Sportiche (p.c.), Donati’s frame­
                             work does not assign analogous structures to the expressions more than 2 and 2, as
                             in (142) and (144):
                             (144) John bought two books.
                                     Hence I will leave aside Donati’s proposal despite its promise and solely
                             focus on the syntactic notion that ER is either a Deg or part of a larger degree ex­
                             pression including the second associate of the comparison.




                                                                          86

                            3.2.2.5 The nature of ER - summary
                                     To sum up, we have seen that ER is not a quantifier. It could be taken to
                            form a quantifier together with its second associate, but since I claim that amount
                            comparisons are a subcase of degree comparisons, I discard such an analysis. I
                            have suggested instead that ER plus the second associate behave as a degree expres­
                            sion, ER itself being a Deg.
                                     Semantically, ER is a function mapping the degree in the second associate
                            into a higher degree. We can alternatively say that ER is a two-place predicate tak­
                            ing degrees as arguments. I take amount comparisons to be a special case of degree
                            comparisons; hence, there is no need to make special provisions here for referring
                            to quantities rather than degrees in the case of amount comparisons.




                                                                           87

                            3.3 Ellipsis in Comparisons
                                     Here I classify comparatives according to what material is logically present
                            but absent in the overt syntax. Then I propose a more general two-way division ac­
                            cording to the presence or absence of an overt verb in the constituent serving as the
                            second associate of the comparison, i.e., the standard for comparison. My later ac­
                            count for the various structures in Chapter 5 will only address the two-way distinc­
                            tion rather than each of the individual construction types presented here, but I clas­
                            sify them first individually in case such a classification may help a reader to orga­
                            nize comparative data in general either in reading this work or for future research.

                            3.3.1 Types of ellipsis in comparisons
                                     Comparatives of the type surveyed in this dissertation vary widely in terms
                            of what material appears after the comparative particle. Here I present a typology of
                            comparatives based on which material appears overtly and which does not. As
                            mentioned above, this typology is meant to orient the reader to the types of con­
                            structions which occur but should not be taken to indicate the scope of this disserta­
                            tion. Only a few of these constructions will be discussed in depth in the space of
                            this work.

                            3.3.1.1 Comparative Ellipsis (CE)
                                     Consider the following sentence, given in English, SLQZ, and Spanish, re­

                                     I define this type of comparison as COMPARATIVE ELLIPSIS. The notion of
                             comparative ellipsis that I will use is slightly different from that of Napoli (1983),
                             who defines comparative ellipsis as         . .an optional rule that deletes material in the
                             comparative clause that is outside the compared constituent, under identity in the
                             matrix sentence in which the head of the comparative clause is embedded.” She at­
                             tributes this definition to Bresnan (1975). What she refers to as the compared con­
                             stituent is actually what I call the second head, so what her definition of CE means
                            in my terms is deleting anything (i.e., at least one element) in the second associate
                             other than the second head.
                                     I deviate from this definition in order to distinguish other constructions
                             which would otherwise be subsumed under CE, such as VP-deletion, null comple­
                             ment anaphora (NCA), gapping, and pseudo-gapping.89 She lays all of these aside
                            from the discussion anyways, claiming that they have explanations independent of
                             comparative sentences since they occur in non-comparative sentences, too. I take
                             CE to apply to those cases fitting the quoted definition but in which all the material
                             in the second associate other than a single contrast, which might simultaneously be
                             the second head, is covert.
                                     In Price’s (1990) terms, some cases of what I am calling comparative ellip­
                             sis are full comparisons (145)-(147), whereas others qualify as partial comparisons:
                             (148) Rodrigo bought more oranges than apples.
                             (149) Rodrigo comprd              mds      naranjas que manzanas.

                                   ‘Rodrigo bought more oranges than apples’
                             (150)         Zye:einy-ru’ nraazh b-zi:i:i’ Rrodriiegw cahmannsaan.

                                     ‘Rodrigo bought more oranges than apples’
                                     If there is more than one contrast in the second associate but no overt verb,
                             then the term that I will use for this phenomenon is gapping, which I will claim is
                                 " There are also a few cases of comparatives involving right node raising, but I do not address
                            right node raising in this dissertation.

                             actually related to CE. However, I distinguish between CE and gapping at the out­
                             set for purely descriptive purposes.
                                      CE is one of the most common, least marked types of comparisons within
                             languages exhibiting particle comparatives. The standard of comparison is implicit
                             in (145)-(147), we are comparing the amount of books that Rodrigo read with the
                             amount of books that Felipe read, not to Felipe himself. Even in (148)-(150), in
                             which we are comparing amount of oranges with amount of apples, we do not have
                             an explicit amount of the latter to compare with.
                                     Even though there is material implicitly present in the second associate, it is
                             worthwhile to note that the only overt material in the second associate is the second
                             term of comparison, Felipe/Liieb in (145)-(147) and apples / manzanas / mannsaan
                             in (148)-(150). The verb read / leyd / bi:i’lly, which is the common ground in
                             (145)-(147), and both the noun phrase Rodrigo / Rrodriiegw and the verb bought /
                             compro / bzi:i:i’, which comprise the common ground in (148)-(150), are covert in
                             their respective sentences. Similarly, the element which would traditionally consid­
                             ered to be the head of the comparison in (145)-(147) books / books / liebr, along
                             with its understood quantifier are covert, whereas in (148)-(150) simply an under­
                             stood quantifier for the noun phrase apples / manzanas / mannsaan is covert. Put
                             into my terminology, the head of the comparisons in both (145)-(147) and (148)-
                             (150) is the abstract quantifier MUCH that I mentioned earlier in is chapter. Both
                             MUCH and the Deg operating over it are covert in (145)-(147) and (148)-(150). In
                             (145)-(147) its complement nominal books / books / liebr is covert and is actually
                             part of the common ground, whereas in (148)-(150), the complement nominal of
                             MUCH is overt - it is the second term of the comparison. It appears that it is
                             preferable for as much as possible of the second associate to be covert, due to either
                             some principle of economy disfavoring the repetition of any recoverable material, or
                             a need to deemphasize any constituent not serving as a contrast so as to maximize
                             emphasis for any constituents which do in fact serve as contrasts, without violating,




                                                                          90

                              3.3.1.2 Comparative deletion (CD)
                                       Comparative deletion is the term used to describe those comparisons in
                              which the second associate contains an almost completely overt clause lacking only
                              an overt second head and optionally its complement (such as a nominal complement
                              to MUCH).90 This type of comparison is possible in SLQZ, Spanish, and
                              English,91although as stated above, there is a preference for as much of the second
                              associate to be covert as possible. Thus, if the verb of the comparative clause is
                              identical to the matrix verb, speakers tend to use CE instead of CD. In the example
                              of CD that follows, notice that in SLQZ and Spanish, there is more than one word
                              separating the first and second associates, whereas in English, there is only one
                              (overt) word separating the two associates:92
                              (151)   Zyeeinny-ru’ ca’rr b-di:i’by Liieb cah nih b-di:i’by Rrodriiegw.

                                    ‘Felipe washed more cars than Rodrigo washed’

                                  90 As I mentioned earlier, 1 take the second head to be MUCH in the case of an amount com­
                             parison. I thank William Leonard for pointing out (p.c.) that in the Spanish example below
                             ((152)), one might consider this quantifier to be overt - its presence is at least witnessed (although
                             not necessarily manifested) by the agreement on los. Similarly, in the non-standard English sen­
                             tences in (i) and (ii), one could conceivably take MUCH to be manifested in the form of the wh-ex-
                             pressions what and how many, respectively.
                                       (i)       ?*Felipe washed more cars than what Rodrigo washed.
                                       (ii)      ?*Felipe washed more cars than how many Rodrigo washed.
                                  Some of these sentences then may not actually be lacking an overt second head, and hence
                             may not fall under the traditional term comparative deletion. In any case, I merely present the tra­
                             ditional term comparative deletion as an expositional convenience. This will not affect my pro­
                             posal of the structures involved in the sentences analyzed in Chapter 5.
                                  91 Note that CD is not allowed in French (cf. Pinkham (1982)). For example, the partitive
                             pronominal clitic en, which stands for covert constituents of the type [de + plural / mass noun],
                             must obligatorily appear in comparisons of noun property amounts (other than in partial compar­
                             isons, where the focus of comparison is overt).
                                       (i) Philippe a lav 6       plus      de voitures que Roger n ’-en a lave.

                                       ‘Phillipe (has) washed more cars than Roger (has) washed’
                                                                                               (en = de voitures ‘of cars’)
                                  92 Notwithstanding the rare dialectal variants proposed in fn (87) in which there are other words
                             overtly present between the two clauses.

                                     Note that according to Price’s terminology, comparative deletion is always a
                            case of full comparison.

                            3.3.1.3 Comparative Subdeletion (CS)
                                     In traditional terminology, comparative subdeletion involves a second asso­
                            ciate which only lacks a quantifier in the case of amount comparisons, a degree in
                            the case of adjectival and adverbial comparisons, and an extent adverbial in the case
                            of verbal comparisons. The only covert element in the comparative clause is the de­
                             gree that operates on the second head.93 Thus, CS under a traditional point of view
                            is a subcase of partial comparison - partial comparisons in which the second associ­
                            ate is overtly clausal, as in Price (1990), are always cases of CS. CS is somewhat
                            marked, and speakers tend to avoid it even in favor of a longer, paratactic construc­
                            tion. CS nonetheless potentially provides us with a view into the structure in­
                            volved in CD, since a given instance of CS can reasonably be conceived of as sim­
                            ply a less covert version of a corresponding instance of CD. Thus, it is semantical­
                            ly reasonable to propose pairing instances of CD with hypothetical paraphrases in­
                            volving CS.

                                 “ It has been suggested to me (Dominique Sportiche (p.c.)) that comparative gapping and
                            comparative pseudogapping should be included as subcases of comparative subdeletion, and hence,
                            that the definition of comparative subdeletion should allow not only for the quantifier to be covert,
                            but also for the verb to be covert in some cases. For the sake of exposition, I will limit the use of
                            the label CS to those cases of comparative subdeletion where neither gapping nor pseudogapping
                            has occurred, i.e., CS only describes cases in which the second associate has an overt lexical verb.
                                 Not all sentences identified here as CS actually involve the same type of structure in my theo­
                            ry —amount comparisons identified as CS, for example, appear, at least in English, to have not
                            only a covert degree but also a covert second head, thus making English amount comparisons look
                            more like another variant of CD. Nevertheless, I present the traditionally terminology for exposi-
                            tional purposes as a point of departure. It will not matter for my analysis.




                                                                            92

                                      Now I turn to the way in which CS occurs in English, Spanish, and SLQZ.

                             3.3.1.3.1 CS in English
                                      In English, CS involves no change of word order - the second associate
                             could function as a complete clause on its own if it were not part of the comparative
                             sentence it is in:
                             (154) Felipe sold more cars than Rodrigo bought pick-up trucks.

                            3.3.1.3.2      CS in Spanish
                                      In Spanish, there are two constructions available for CS. First, the second
                             head (or the complement of the covert second head MUCH in my terminology, in
                             the case of amount comparisons) can be preposed to the beginning of the second as­
                             sociate. In this subtype of CS, the second head occupies what seems to be a focus
                             position (although Price (1990) refers to this as a TOPICAUZED SENTENTIAL CON­
                             STRUCTION). This is shown in (155):
                             (155) Felipe lav6                  mds         coches
                                   Felipe wash.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.rn.pl cars
                                           que camionetas             lavdj       Rodrigo,
                                           that pick.up.trucks wash.pret.3sg Rodrigo
                                     ‘Felipe washed more cars than Rodrigo washed pick-up trucks’
                                      I do not discuss this construction further but instead refer the reader to S£ez
                             (1990) and Price (1990).
                                      Another type of CS allowed by some speakers of Spanish’4involves a parti­
                             tive use of the preposition de ‘of’.




                                 84 Note, as a point of comparison, that this construction is perfectly allowed in French, a lan­
                             guage which disallows CD:
                                 (i) Philippe a lavd            plus       de voitures que Roger n’-a          lavd
                                     Philippe has washed ER.MUCH of cars               that Roger not-has washed
                                                de camions,
                                                of trucks
                                      ‘Phillipe washed more cars than Roger washed trucks’

                                     I present an analysis of this construction in Chapter 5.
                                     Lastly, there is a construction in Spanish parallel to the English construction
                            above which Sdez (1993) treats as perfectly normal, although the remaining litera­
                            ture (e.g., Price (1990)), as well as native speakers consulted consider it to be en­
                            tirely ungrammatical in Spanish. I mark it as ungrammatical to reflect the majority
                            dialect and do not pursue an analysis of it but include it here for the sake of illustra­
                            tion and refer the interested reader to Sdez (1990) for an analysis:

                            3.3.1.3.3 CS in SLQZ
                                     My consultant’s first choice for a translation of an English CS sentence is a
                            paratactic construction as in (158):
                            (158)          Zye:einy-ru’ ca’rr b-di:i’by Liieb. Du:u’zh-ru’     camione’t
                                     MUCH.sol/abs-ER car perf-wash Felipe NEG.MUCH-ER pick.up.truck
                                              b-di:i’by Rrodriiegw.
                                             perf-wash Rodrigo
                                     ‘Felipe washed more cars. Rodrigo washed fewer pick-up trucks’
                                     However, there is also another available construction in which the word
                            ze’cy,K meaning ‘thus’, appears in the second associate between the comparative
                            particle ze’cy and a relative clause:97


                                85 The Spanish word, lo is the neuter form of the definite article.
                                88 The word ze’cy is also part of the word ze’c y d y a meaning literally ‘such an amount', with
                            -dya’ being the actual carrier of the notion MUCH. Pamela Munro claims (p.c.) that dya‘ does not
                            mean MUCH exactly but does generally carry a notion of extent. I will gloss it as MUCH for the
                            sake of simplicity and leave the exact identity of this element open for further research.
                                871 discuss the nature of relative clauses in comparative constructions in Chapter 5.

                                       ‘Felipe washed more cars than Rodrigo washed pick-up trucks’
                                       In this construction, ze’cy seems to be quantifying over the entire proposi­
                             tion Rodrigo washed pick-up trucks rather than locally quantifying over the noun
                            pick-up trucks specifically. In other words, (159) seems to mean something like
                             (159’):
                            (159’) {Felipe washed more cars than the way in which [meaning the extent to
                                          which] Rodrigo washed pick-up trucks}
                                       A final structure in SLQZ which can translate English amount comparisons
                            involving CS but which evidently does not exhibit comparative subdeletion, since
                            the word ze’cydya’ ‘such an amount’ is an overt marker of the amount of trucks at
                            hand, is shown in (160):

                            3.3.1.4 Null Complement Anaphora (NCA)
                                       NCA occurs in both comparative and non-comparative sentences, the latter
                            case being mainly restricted to English. In either case, a predicate such as a modal
                            (epistemic or deontic), an auxiliary, a verb of volition, or a verb of communication /
                            perception, which normally takes an overt verb phrase (English only) or clausal
                            complement, appears superficially without one. The missing complement must be
                            salient in the discourse context and is most often mentioned one sentence prior, for
                            instance, the first member of two conjoined clauses (161) or a question in a ques­
                            tion / answer pair (162).
                            (161) John doesn’t ever do his hom ework, but he really should (do his hom
                                          work).

                                  A. Because he has to (do his homework).
                                      In comparative NCA (163), the covert complement is signalled by an overt
                            copy in the main clause, and the second associate actually includes an overt verb,
                            namely the NCA verb (in fact, only the complement of this NCA verb is covert):

                                      Null complement anaphora is always a case of full comparison according to
                            Price’s (1990) terminology.

                            3.3.1.5 Gapping
                                      Gapping is possible in Spanish and English but not in SLQZ. Like NCA, it
                            occurs in both comparative and non-comparative sentences, although some speak­
                            ers of English do not allow gapping at all in comparative sentences - they allow
                            (165) but not (168) or (170), for instance. In gapping, a clause appears with some
                            of its constituents intact but is distinctly missing an (overt) verb, as well as tense,
                            although they must both of course be recoverable within the discourse context. In

                                 “ The abbreviations ‘imp’ and ‘subj’ in Spanish glosses refer to the imperfect tense and the
                             subjunctive mood, respectively.
                                 ss There is also a variant of this example in which the element representing abstract amount
                             discussed above—ze’cydya' —is also present:

                             non-comparative instances of gapping (165)-(166), the gapped verb is a constituent
                             of the second conjunct of two conjoined clauses. The overt members of the second
                             conjunct are those elements that contrast with parallel elements in the first member
                             of the conjunct. There are many restrictions on what types of elements may remain
                             overt in the second, gapped conjunct Nouns occur most freely, whereas preposi­
                             tional phrases, adjectives and pronouns are more restricted. There are many factors
                             involved here, such as word order, definiteness effects and status as adjunct vs. ar­
                             gument, but a detailed explanation would take me too far afield. Therefore, I just il­
                             lustrate here with a few examples:
                             SLQZ [gapping is disallowed]
                             (164) *B-da’uhw Liieb bxgaradv chieru’ Rrodriiegw gueht.

                                      ‘Felipe ate chapulines, and Rodrigo (ate) tortillas’
                             English
                             (165) Felipe ate chapulines. and Rodrigo, tortillas.
                                     ‘Felipe ate chapulines, and Rodrigo (ate) tortillas’
                             Spanish
                             (166)    Felipe      comio chapulines. y Rodrigo
                                      Felipe eat.pret.3sg chapulines and Rodrigo                    tortillas
                                     ‘Felipe ate pizza, and Rodrigo (ate) tortillas’

                                      In comparative gapping (167)-(170), the second associate is superficially
                             subclausal, i.e., it appears to be some constituent smaller than a clause.1” Note that
                             if there were only one contrast in the second term of a comparsion, then we would
                             simply have a case of comparative ellipsis.101 Thus I take comparative gapping to
                             simply be a special case of CE involving more than one contrast.
                                      Comparative gapping may occur, in Spanish and English, in either full com­
                             parison or partial comparisons:



                                 100 In GB terms, I use the term subclausal constituent to refer to any proper subpart of an IP.
                                 101 For example, the sentences in (167)-(170) without the doubly-underlined elements in the
                             second associate would be cases of CE in my terminology.




                                                                              97

                                     Pamela Munro and William Leonard (p.c.) point out that comparative gap­
                             ping is out even in English for some speakers. Although this requires an explana­
                             tion, I note here that such sentences are fine in my judgment, and such data has
                             been quoted in the literature. The following sentences are from Napoli (1983, p.
                             676) and Corver (1993, p.777), respectively:
                             (172) Mary loves Fellini more than John, Bertolucci.

                             (173) John knows more Romance languages than Pete Germanic languages.

                                     Some of the variation in acceptability of comparative gapping in English
                             may stem from whether a comparison is full or partial and whether or not the two

                             which case CE rather than comparative gapping would be at work.
                                      I discuss comparative gapping further in Chapter 5.

                             3.3.1.6 Pseudogapping
                                      Pseudogapping, like gapping and NCA, occurs in both comparative and
                             non-comparative sentences, but unlike gapping, it does not occur in Spanish, nor
                             does it occur in SLQZ, which disallows both gapping and pseudogapping. In
                             pseudogapping,103a verb is covert, but tense surfaces overtly, whether via an auxil­
                             iary verb or a modal. Of course, pseudogapping requires that the gapped verb (and
                             any other gapped material) be recoverable, whether the construction is non-compar­
                             ative (174) or comparative (175).
                                      Although tense is not covert in pseudogapping,104any of the internal argu­
                             ments of the verb that do not serve as foci of contrast must be covert in addition to
                             the verb, since they are recoverable from a previous clause ((174b,c,d) and
                             (175b,c,d)).




                                  102For example, the string books to Bill in (i) might be interpreted as a small clause, and
                             hence a single constituent complement of V, rather than simply a sequence of a DP followed by a
                             PP, both following a verb in a (disallowed) ternary structure:
                                 (i) I gave more magazines to Sue than Books to Bill.
                                 103 Napoli (1983), for example, gives the following sentences as examples of pseudogapping,
                             based on Levin (1978 and 1979):
                                 (i) John would lie to Sue sooner than Bill would to Jane.              [her example #4d]
                                 (ii) John speaks against many more friends than he does enemies, [her example #i in fn#4]
                                 104 If tense were covert in this type of sentence, the result might be grammatical, but this
                             would be a case of gapping rather than pseudogapping.




                                                                            99

                                     A subject, which is an external argument, behaves differently than the inter­
                             nal arguments of the verb. Even if the subject is identical in both clauses, and
                             hence is not a focus of contrast, it must be overt not only in the clause with an overt
                             verb but also in the clause missing a verb ((174d) and (175d)) (although cf. fn
                             (106)). This follows from the fact that non-pro-drop languages like English always


                                  105 In (174) and (175), the material in brackets is only intended to suggest the meaning of the
                            gapped material. Interestingly enough, as pointed out by Pamela Munro, it is not the case in all
                            of these examples that an equivalent non-gapped sentence with the same meaning may appear sim­
                            ply by producing overt copies of the bracketed material. Specifically, there is an incompatibility
                            between the appearance of non-emphatic do and the material proposed in brackets. I suggest that
                            both pseudogapping and do-support are occurring simultaneously in such cases.
                                  Although I do not have an explanation for this problem, note that there is a more general re­
                            striction, by which do-support (comparative or not) may only cooccur with an overt lexical verb in
                            interrogative or emphatic contexts:
                                        (i)     Maria, why did you decide not to travel to Europe last summer?
                                        (ii)    I DID go to Europe last summer !
                                  As predicted, cooccurrence of do and a lexical verb is possible in sentences similar to (174a)
                            (ie., we can “ungap” pseudogapped sentences) but which involve an emphatic context, such as in
                            (174d) (unless never is stressed instead of did) or in (iii) or (iv):
                                        (iii)   I told them that I date guys, and I in fact DO date guys.
                                        (iv)    ?I DON’T call my mom more often than I DO call her.
                                  108 I thank Pamela Munro for pointing out (p.c.) that the subject of the second conjunct is ac­
                            tually optional in this case. I will assume that the version without an overt subject involves con­
                            joining verb phrases instead of entire clauses and that the external argument of the verb (i.e., the
                            subject) may not be deleted in the case of clausal conjunction.
                                  Munro also points out that the subject must be obligatorily present in comparative pseudo­
                            gapping even if non-contrastive (cf. (175d)). This follows logically if we assume, as I do, that
                            cases such as the version of (174d) without he are not pseudogapping but rather VP-conjunction,
                            and that comparative pseudogapping necessarily involves two clauses, rather than merely verb
                            phrases.




                                                                            100

                             require an overt subject whenever there is overt tense, a condition which coincides,
                             aside from the case of pseudogapping, with the presence of an overt lexical verb.
                             Hence, even expletive subjects cannot be omitted in cases of pseudogapping,107and
                             any apparent counterexample such as the version of (176) without it should be con­
                             sidered VP-conjunction rather than pseudogapping (cf. fn (106))
                             (176) It rained a lot yesterday, and *(it) could [rain a lot] again today.
                             [It can be absent in case of VP-conjunction but is obligatory in pseudogapping]
                                      Since (177) is a case of comparative pseudogapping, it necessarily involves
                             clausal conjunction, and hence,// cannot be ommitted.
                             (177) It rained more yesterday than *(it) will [rain] today.
                                      Note that comparative pseudogapping may involve either full or partial com­
                             parison, as in (175b)-(175d) and (175a), respectively.
                                      Since comparative pseudogapping does not occur in either Spanish or
                             SLQZ, I do not explore it any further in this dissertation.

                             3.3.1.7 VP-deletion
                                      VP-DELETION is a term used (e.g., Napoli        (1983)) to refer to a subcase of
                             NCA in which the missing complement is a Verb Phrase.108 Since NCA is unavail­
                             able in SLQZ and Spanish in those cases where the missing complement is a verb
                             phrase (vs. a clause), VP-deletion is unavailable in SLQZ and Spanish. One specif­
                             ic case of VP-deletion that especially highlights its restriction to English is the phe­
                             nomenon of do-support, as exemplified in (178). Note that in a case of VP-deletion
                             where do-support occurs simultaneously, there is no corresponding grammatical
                             equivalent in which both the verb do and the underlying lexical verb phrase are
                             overt (178’) (unless there is a contrast of the type DO vs. DON’T - cf. fn (105)).
                             (178) Felipe dances more wildly than Rodrigo does [dance wildly].

                                  107 Recall that pseudogapping is not possible in the pro-drop languages under study here.
                                  108The covert complement in NCA can be either a verb phrase or a clausal complement (the
                             latter being either an IP or a CP in GB terms), depending on the particular NCA predicate.




                                                                           101

                                      VP-deletion is almost always a case of full comparison. One possible case
                             in which it is not is the type of sentence in (179), a somewhat marginal partial com­

                                      Since VP-deletion is unavailable in Spanish or SLQZ, I will not discuss it

                             generated as such. However, I will assume that these elements are not absent structurally at any
                             level (although they may lack internal structure).
                                  1.0 In amount comparisons, not only is what I argue to be the true head of such comparisons,
                             MUCH, covert, but also its lexical noun complement. If its lexical noun complement is overt,
                             then the sentence falls into the traditional category of comparative subdeletion.
                                  1.1 In amount comparisons, I take the actual second head to be the abstract quantifier MUCH,
                             and hence, amount comparisons traditionally taken to be cases of CS are actually cases of CD in
                             which the second head’s lexical noun complement is overt.

                            3.3.2 A more general division
                                      We can make a more general division of comparatives based on the status of
                            the constituent following the comparative particle: those cases where the constituent
                            following the comparative particle contains an overt verb (often called CLAUSAL
                            COMPARATIVES),       and those cases where it does not (often called PHRASAL COM­
                            PARATIVES).


                            3.3.2.1 Constituent with overt verb follows comparative particle
                                       In cases where a non-auxiliary verb appears overtly (comparative deletion,
                            comparative subdeletion, and many cases of null complement anaphora),112and
                            even in cases where only an auxiliary verb appears overtly (other cases of NCA,
                            VP-deletion, pseudogapping), the initial intuition is that there is structurally an en­

                                112 Even though a verb (auxiliary or not) always appears after the comparative particle in
                            NCA, we must also explain the nature of its covert complement Regarding the point at hand,
                            though, we can at least group NCA with the other ellipsis types here since the presence of the
                            NCA verb implies the existence of a clause after the particle just as much as the presence of non-
                            NCA verbs in the other types.




                                                                              103

                             amined more closely in Chapter 5 except in case of pseudogapping and VP-dele­
                             tion, which as I indicated earlier do not occur in Spanish or SLQZ.

                             3.3.2.2 Comparative without an overt verb follows comparative particle
                                     In CE and gapping, there is no overt verb after the comparative particle.
                             Therefore, it is not clear whether the contrasts are actually found in (or originate in)
                             a subordinate comparative clause, a conjoined phrase or clause, or merely a prepo­
                             sitional phrase. This may vary cross-linguistically and some languages seem to
                             have more than one of these options available. I will address this question in detail
                             in Chapter 5.

                             3.4 Variation in Comparative Particle
                                      Recall that the second associate in a comparative construction of the type
                             studied in this dissertation is linked to the first associate by its first element, a COM­
                             PARATIVE PARTICLE —a catch-all        term used by linguists studying comparatives
                             (e.g., Stassen (1985)) to describe what really appears to be a heterogenous set of
                             items. Various comparative particles have been claimed to be complementizers,
                             prepositions, coordinators, quantifiers, wh-elements, and determiners. Whatever
                             the identity of comparative particles may be, it is not at all obvious (in fact I show
                             that it is not the case) that they are all of the same syntactic nature.
                                      In English, the single particle than is used in most comparative construc­
                             tions.113 Spanish, on the other hand, has a more varied repertoire of comparative
                             particles, as does SLQZ, so I present the distribution patterns in these two lan­
                             guages below.

                             3.4.1 Spanish
                                      Spanish comparatives make recourse to de, que, and various larger units in­
                             volving de and/or que in comparisons of inequality. I treat the various cases below.
                             I do not, however, present data involving como, the particle used in comparisons of
                             equality, since comparisons of equality are mainly beyond the scope of this work.

                             3.4.1.1 Que only
                                      The word que appears alone as a comparative particle (i.e., is not preceded
                             by de plus other material) in several cases. The material following que does not




                                 113 A major exception are comparatives of equality, which most commonly use as.




                                                                           105

                             contain any overt finite verbs except in two special cases which I will not address.114
                             Aside from those two cases, the following are the key instances of this type of com­
                             parative.

                             3.4.1.1.1 Que followed by a second term of comparison containing non-verbal
                             contrasts
                                      This type of structure is found in instances of comparative ellipsis (if there
                             is only contrast) and gapping (if there is more than one contrast) and may involve
                             full comparison or partial comparison:

                             (180) a.          Julia        canta      mejor    que  yo.
                                               Julia sing.pres.3sg well.ER that lsg.nom
                                                ‘Julia sings better than me’115
                                                [one contrast: Julia vs. me]        [CE, full comparison]
                                      b.       Julia     compr6      mtis           naranjas que manzanas.
                                               Julia buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl oranges that apples
                                                ‘Julia bought more oranges than apples’
                                                [one contrast oranges vs. apples]    [CE, partial comparison]




                                   1,4 The first such case is a partial comparison in which the extent or frequency of one type of
                             activity or condition that is true of a particular individual is compared to the extent of frequency of
                             another type of activity or condition that is true of that individual (cf. below §3.4.1.1.1). In other
                             words, this is a case in which the second head is the extent of a verb. For example:
                                   (i) Patricia       camind         m£s     que durmio          durante su-s vacaciones.
                                        Patricia walk.pret.3sg ER.MUCH that sleep.pret.3sg during 3-pl vacation
                                   ‘Patricia walked more [i.e., for a longer time or more often] than she slept during her vacation’
                                   The second such case is where the comparison is o f the type: It is more the case that X than
                             it is the case that Y (referred to as an EPISTEMICREADING (Napoli (1983)) or a METALINGUISTIC
                             READING (McCawley (1988)):
                                   (ii) Enrique      solicitaba trabajo          mris   que      pedfa        limosna.
                                        Enrique seek.imp3sg work ER.MUCH that ask.for.imp.3sg charity
                                        ‘Enrique was looking for a job more than he was begging’
                                   I have glossed mds here as ‘ER.MUCH’ since it means to a greater extent:
                                   {It was the case that Enrique was looking for a job to a greater extent than it was the case that
                             he was begging.}
                                   Other glosses such as rath.ER or trueJER could also be argued. It is not immediately clear
                             which is the best gloss, and I leave this open for further research.
                                   IIs Note that this would be Julia sings better than I in formal English.

                                   118Note that the English translation of (58) would actually be quite marginal with either me or
                             I as the second associate contrast if the auxiliary verb did were not present; that is, a structure with
                             pseudogapping is prefared:
                                   (i) *?Alfredo spent more time in Belgium than I/me in the Carribean.
                                   Note, however, that gapping is more acceptable if nominal foci are used instead of pronominal
                             foci.
                                   (ii) ?Alfredo spent more time in Belgium than Enrique in the Carribean.
                                   In any case, I return to the I/me alternation in Chapter 5.
                                   1,7 Recall that this is a case of comparative gapping, which may not be acceptable to all
                             speakers of Spanish. Those who do not accept this would need to resort to a construction with an
                             overt verb, as discussed below.

                             is being compared. Instead, a presupposition about the contents of a set is shown
                             to have overlooked some of the contents of the set In other words, what are as­
                             sumed to be all of the elements of the set are in fact only an improper subset of the
                             entire set.
                                     In (182), for example, the speaker is challenging a presupposition about the
                             set of types of things which the individual named Felipe needs (some amount of).
                             That is, the set of items that Felipe needs some amount of includes more elements
                             than just water and bread - it also includes love and studies.
                             (182) Felipe necesita       mds        que agua v pan       - tambidn

                                            necesita amor y estudios.

                                   ‘Felipe needs more than water and bread - he also needs love and studies’
                                     The set referred to in this type of comparison may actually contain specific
                             individuals instead of just types. In (183), for example, the set of individuals that
                             Rodrigo saw includes more elements than just the speaker - it also includes the in­
                             dividual named Frederica
                             (183) Rodrigo     vio            mds que a          mf      sol-o - tambien

                                   ‘Rodrigo saw more than just me - he also saw Frederica’
                                     It is interesting to note that this subset-as-a-standard construction is some­
                             what marked cross-linguistically. For example, it is not allowed in either SLQZ or
                            Italian. It is often paraphrased using correlative elements such as “not only... but
                             also” or special adverbial expressions of the type “In addition to X, Y”:
                             (183’) Rodrigo       vio     no s61o a         mf      sino que tambien

                                    ‘Rodrigo saw not only just me but he also saw Frederica’
                             (183”) Ademds de (a)          mf, Rodrigo tambien vio        a Frederica

                                      Note also that there is one subclass of this construction which is ambiguous
                             between a true subset reading and an implicit comparison-of-quality reading. In
                             (184), for example, Rodrigo didn’t (necessarily) find aplastic ring - he found
                             something much better (there being an implicit qualitative adjective good under the
                             comparison-of-quality reading)- a gold ring that had once belonged to the famous
                             Mexican president Benito Juarez.
                             (184) Rodrigo encontrd             mds que un mer-o aniHo de pldstico -

                                   ‘Rodrigo found more than a mere plastic ring - he found a gold ring that had
                                          previously belonged to President Benito Juarez’
                                      Lastly, note that this type of comparison, unlike other types, does not allow
                             substitution of menos que ‘less than’ or tonto como ‘as much as’ in place of mas
                             que. This has led some (eg., Prytz (1979)) to consider this type of comparison not
                             to be a true comparison. SLQZ, as well as other languages such as Italian, disallow
                             this construction, and I will not pursue any analysis of it.

                             3.4.1.1.3 Que followed by fronted second head and verb
                                     In this construction, seen in (185), the second head is fronted, followed im­
                             mediately by the verb of the comparative clause and then any remaining con­
                             stituents.
                             (185) Elena es mdsalt-a que             guap-o   es Juan.
                                   Elena be.3sg ER tall-f that handsome-m be.3sg Juan
                                   ‘Elena is more tall than Juan is handsome’
                                     If the second head is a verb itself, then the verb follows que immediately,
                             and the remainder of the clause follows:
                             (186) Elena corre          mds que gmyga Juan.
                                   Elena run.3sg ER.MUCH that walk.3sg Juan
                                   ‘Elena runs more than Juan walks’
                                   [two contrasts: Elena vs. Juan and corre vs. camina]




                                                                          109

                                       Price (1990) notes that in order for a structure like (186) to be grammatical,
                             something in addition to, or instead of, tense must form a contrast For example,
                             the second term in (186) contains two contrasts: camina ‘walks’ and Juan. If tense
                             is the only contrast present, then this structure may not be used (cf. (187) vs.
                             (188)):
                             (187) Elena corre           mds         que corre Susana.
                                   Elena run.3sg ER.MUCH that run.3sg Susana
                                   ‘Elena runs more than Susan’
                                   [only one contrast, but it is Elena vs. su mama (not TENSE), sentence is
                                           grammatical]
                             (188) *Elena corre           mds      que coma.
                                   Elena run.3sg ER.MUCH that run.imp.3sg
                                   ‘Elena runs more than she used to run’
                                   [only one contrast, it is TENSE, sentence is out]
                                       I do not provide an analysis of this construction but instead refer the inter­
                            ested reader to Price (1990) and Sdez (1990) for discussion on this matter.

                            3.4.1.2      De with no (at least overt) subsequent clause
                                       There are two subvarieties of this comparative strategy. In both types, de is
                            immediately preceded by mas.
                            3.4.I.2.1 Reference amount is a simple cardinal number or measure phrase, i.e.,
                                          the standard of comparison is explicit
                                       Rather than comparing the amount of a noun type or the degree of an adjec­
                            tival property associated with an individual (the comparee) to the amount associated
                            with a second individual (a second term contrast connected with an implicit standard
                            of comparison), a cardinal number or measure phrase is provided by itself as a stan­
                            dard for comparison. Thus, there is no second term in this type of comparison. In
                            (189), for example, the amount of pictures associated with Ignacia, or more specifi­
                            cally, the number of pictures that she painted, is given simply as more than sixty
                            rather than defined in a more complex manner as being more pictures than those as­
                            sociated with some other individual:




                                                                         110

                                     It is in fact this construction on which I model my analysis of comparatives
                             of the type in §3.4.1.5.

                             to the formula given immediately above, and the second member, exhibiting NCA,
                             is given in order to clarify the interpretation of the first member. The second mem­
                             ber of each pair is, however, somewhat marked syntactically, since the adjective in
                             question is used with an overt complement clause unnecessarily.

                                      I suspect that each regularly-numbered example is syntactically related to its
                             paired prime example. I refer the interested reader to Sdez (1990) for an analysis of
                             this construction.

                                      Note that in both subcases, the clause following a form of cuanto may not
                             be introduced by que.

                             3.4.1.3.1 Cuanto with number / gender agreement
                                     This subcase may only be used in comparisons of quantity, and cuanto
                             agrees with the noun type whose quantity is being compared.

                             briefly discuss it in Chapter 5. I refer the interested reader to Sdez (1990) for a
                             more detailled discussion of it.

                             3.4.1.4 De with subsequent lo or agreeing definite article + que + clause123
                                      This type represents the usual strategy for forming a comparative when a
                             conjugated verb is overtly present after the comparative particle, and it is the pre­
                             ferred alternate to the marginal type presented in §3.4.1.3.
                                      However, this formulation may be avoided and replaced either by the type
                             discussed in §3.4.1.1.1 or by the type in §3.4.1.1.3 if the second head is overt and
                             fronted (presumably to focus position). As mentioned earlier, this second head
                             may even be a verb, as long as tense is not the only contrast present (i.e., a contrast
                                  123 There is also a variety of comparatives with que + lo I agreeing definite article + que, in
                             which lo (or an agreeing form of lo) means roughly aquello'that’ (or aquel, etc. ‘the one(s)’ in the
                             case of the agreeing forms). A few speakers prefer this formulation over the one given in this sec­
                             tion to express the same meaning. However, for many speakers, there is a difference in interpreta­
                             tion. The de los que formulation makes a claim about number only, whereas the que los que for­
                             mulation makes a claim about the number of a specific, referential standard of comparison (al­
                             though some speakers apparently have the exact opposite judgment). Compare the following:

                             el que (etc.) behave differently when transformed into comparisons of equality - the entire unitdel
                             que (etc.) gets replaced by como, whereas only the subunit que in que el que gets replaced by
                             como:

                             contrast in tense).
                                     In fact, this formula is dispreferred whenever a simpler one with que alone
                             is allowed (even though this means choosing covert forms, of recoverable material
                             of course, instead of overt forms), a condition which seems to result from a reluc­
                             tance to repeat material unnecessarily. Another possible reason for avoiding this
                             construction is potential confusion with a partitive reading.124
                                     Note that in some instances the neuter lo is used, while other times, an
                            agreeing form (eg.,el) is used. Judgments concerning which of the two types is
                            possible in a given sentence vary from speaker to speaker, although I provide an
                            analysis of each type in Chapter 5 for an idealized dialect of Spanish.

                                     This strategy may only be used in comparisons of quantity, and the form of
                            the definite article after de agrees in number and gender with the noun type whose
                            amount is being compared.

                                      These items all translate as ‘more than’ and are probably various manifesta­
                             tions of the same element in free variation with each other.126 I refer to this element
                             most often as maazda ’ since that is how it occurred most often in my initial investi­
                             gations, although I use other variants if elicited as such. The element at hand is
                             used in comparatives of quantity when the standard is explicit, i.e., when the num­

                                   12SIn all other types of (quantitative) SLQZ comparatives of inequality, the element ru’ sur­
                             faces, with ntaa(z) appearing only optionally. The fact that maaz appears here independently of
                             ru ’ presents a challenge for my previous assertion that it is merely a dummy head in sentences
                             where ru’ appears simultaneously.
                                   128They are not, however, the same lexical item as the SLQZ morpheme with the ho-
                             mophonous allomorphs ta' / da\ which is aDeg meaning ‘too (much)’ (cf. Chapter 2).

                             rather than being compared to the amount associated with a second term contrast

                             3.4.2.2 Cah (+ nod) followed by noun phrase129130
                                      This formulation is perhaps the most common comparative construction in
                             SLQZ. It involves CE and may either involve full comparison or partial compari­
                             son, the latter case being restricted to amount comparisons.
                                      When CE involves a full comparison, the noun phrase following cah is the
                             second associate contrast:
                             (202) Maaz-ru’ r-zh:u:u’nny Liieb cah (noo) Rrodriiegw.
                                   MAAZ-ER hab-run           Felipe than (NOO) Rodrigo
                                   ‘Felipe runs more than Rodrigo’




                                  127 I have also come across one instance in SLQZ of the sequence Maazda’ cah in which the
                             following dement is not a numeral, but rather, the word sufisye’eennd 'enough’. I include this
                             here for the sake of completeness, but I have no explanation for i t The whole sequence shown
                             here means ‘more than enough’.
                             (76)        Maaz-da’ cah sufisye’eemid comiied b-da’uhw-a’.
                                        MAAZ-than than enough food perf-eat-lsg
                                        ‘I ate more than enough food’
                                  128 It seems that here, maaz should include the denotations of zye:einy, i.e., MUCH.sol/abs,
                             and ER, but I gloss it here simply as ‘MAAZ’ since I do not have enough information at this
                             point to undertake an in-depth analysis of the various cases of this element, some of which occur
                             in the same sentence as zye:einy and -ru’.
                                  129 The word cah is apparently in free variation with queh, both of which seem to have derived
                             from the Spanish word que.
                                  130 Noo is apparently a borrowing based on Spanish no, which appears marginally in some
                             comparatives in that language.
                                  Noo appears fredy after cah in SLQZ comparatives but not in those types of comparisons dis­
                             cussed in §3.4.2.1 and §3.4.2.5.

                                     This construction is dispreferred in a comparison which could otherwise be
                            expressed using CE, i.e. a comparison in which there is only one contrast and it is a
                            noun phrase. However, it is obligatory if the contrast is verbal or in cases of NCA
                            (i.e., when the lower clause corresponding to the matrix clause is the covert com­
                            plement of a predicate such as a control verb, raising verb or modal). Thus, this
                            construction involves CD, CS, or NCA.133

                            3.4.2.3.1     Cah alone (+ noo) + nih + clause

                                 131 There is also an additional possibility for word order available for this type of structure than
                            when the noun phrase following cah ( + noo) is the second associate contrast. For example, (79)
                            has the following variant:
                                 (i) Zye:einy-ru’ me’s cah studya’aannd b-zehnny.
                             MUCH.sol/abs-ER teachers than student perf-arrive
                                      ‘More teachers than students arrived’
                                 This has ramifications for the type of structure underlying such constructions (cf. Keenan
                            (1987), Saez (1990)).
                                 132Note that if the second head is a verb or an adjective, another formulation type is necessary
                            —an overt subordinate clause containing the verb surfaces (Cf §3.4.23).
                                 133Recall that gapping, pseudogapping, and VP-deletion are disallowed in SLQZ.

                                      The word ze’cydya’, as mentioned earlier, means roughly ‘such an
                             amount’. It is therefore not a surprise that this type of structure is only possible
                             with comparisons of amount This construction involves either NCA (208) or CD

                                  134 Lia is a title word used before a woman’s name in SLQZ.
                                  135This construction appears somewhat marked, perhaps since the element ze’cydya’ is option­
                             al for a sentence with this type of interpretation. Since it did surface in some of the sentences
                             elicited, it is worth investigating how optional it really is.
                                  133This construction is all but entirely out except in partial comparisons of amount, i.e., in
                             those comparisons where the amount of one KIND is being compared with the amount of another
                             KIND (i.e., X [verbed] more Y than A [verbed] B, where Y and B are KINDS)

                                      This construction involves CS. As was the case of the same structure but
                             without an overt noun phrase, the presence of the word ze’cydya’ correlates with a
                             restriction of these structures to quantity comparisons only.
                                      Sometimes the noun phrase is not preceded by ra (210).137 In this subcase,
                             the noun whose quantity is being compared follows ze’cydya’ directly.

                                      Sometimes the noun phrase is preceded by ra:
                             (211) Zye:einy-ru’ bx:aa:ady b-da’uhw-u’ cah (noo) ze’cy-dya’ ra

                                   ‘You ate more chapulines than I ate apples’
                                      In this subtype, the noun whose quantity is being compared and ze'cydya’
                             are not string adjacent but rather are separated by ra. Note that (210) is perfectly
                             fine without ra, so it cannot be entirely equivalent to plural markers in languages
                             such as English and Spanish. In any case, ra deserves special attention of its own
                             that is beyond the scope of this dissertation.

                             3.4.2.3.4 Cah + (noo) + noun phrase + nih + sentence
                                      This is another type of construction available for comparisons of quantity.
                             Notice that the word ze’cydya’ ‘amount’ does not surface.
                                      As was the case for ze’cydya’ amount comparisons, the element ra is not
                             obligatory before the nominal second head*
                             (212) Zye:einy-ru’ bx:aa:ady b-da’uhw-u’ cah (noo) mannsaan nih

                                   ‘You ate more chapulines than I ate apples’
                                  137 As mentioned in Chapter 2, the element ra appears to be some type of plural marker. It is
                             not clear how its presence or absence might be relevant to the constructions under discussion.




                                                                             119

                                      However, the element ra does sometimes surface in this type of construc­
                             tion:
                             (213) Zye:einy-ru’ bx:aa:ady b-da’uhw-u’ cah (noo) ra mannsaan nih

                                      Again, it is not clear what the significance of its presence vs. its absence in

                                      Consider the schemata in (216) and (217), which are potential sources for
                             sentences such as (27), with underlining and double underlining used to show adja­
                             cency of ER and the constituent introduced by the comparative particle, and bold­
                             face used to indicate the head of the comparative:140
                             (216) The girls sang [ER than Ithe number of songs that the bovs sane!
                                          MUCH.pl] songs.
                             (217) The girls sang [[a degree which is greater than Ithe degree.MUCH.pl songs
                                          that the bovs sanell MUCH.pl] songs.

                             (218) The girls sang more songs than the boys.
                                      Whether (216) or (217) is closer to the actual underlying source for (218),
                            note that (219), in which ER and overt part of the second associate are contiguous,
                             is impossible:
                             (219) *The girls sang more                         songs.

                                      Comparing (218) with (219), we see that full comparisons of the type found
                             (218) exhibit obligatory Spellout discontinuity of ER and the second associate - in
                             traditional terminology, this would involve rightward extraposition of the second
                            associate in traditional terminology. The actual mechanism involved cannot taken to
                             be rightward movement of any kind within the framework assumed here but would
                            instead presumably involve leftward movement of ER and stranding of the second
                            associate. Note the stranded second associate is located all the way at the right pe­
                             riphery of the sentence.
                                     Discontinuity between ER and the second associate also occurs in analytic
                             adjectival and adverbial comparisons. Hence, (220) is grammatical, but (221) is
                            not

                                  140 As mentioned earlier, I claim in Chapter 4 that the head in comparisons of amount is actu­
                             ally a covert (English/Spanish) or overt (SLQZ) morpheme of quantity, MUCH, the degree of
                             which is operated on by ER. I assume that MUCH is already combined with mds by Spellout, al­
                             though this cannot be proven based purely on empirical grounds, since MUCH is covert.




                                                                            122

                                     Such discontinuity is not observed in verbal extent comparisons (222) or
                            synthetic adjectival (223) and adverbial comparisons:
                            (222) Wilfredo swims more than me.
                                         [where the makeup of more is ER.MUCH]
                            (223) Wilfredo is taller than me.

                                     Spanish displays the same pattern as English with regard to which types of
                            comparisons involve discontinuity between ER and its second associate. Amount

                            (227) show this discontinuity,141whereas verbal extent extent comparisons, as in
                            (228), as well as the few synthetic adjectival and adverbial comparisons there are,
                            such as the one shown in (229), do not show this discontinuity:

                            isons for the sake of brevity. The adverbial comparisons share the relevant properties with the ad­
                            jectival comparisons.
                                 142 The order in which I have written the morphemes in this gloss is arbitrary, since MUCH is
                            covert and its position is not directly detectable.

                                     We see that the discontinuity pattern in SLQZ is slightly different than the
                             one seen in English and Spanish - in verbal extent comparisons, there is no discon­
                             tinuity between ER and the second associate, whereas there is in the corresponding
                             sentences in Spanish and English.
                                     I signal that it is important to understand why the discontinuity pattern
                             varies within a given language and between languages with regards to type of com­
                             parison. I do not provide an answer here, but the solution must lie in a careful elab­
                             oration of the structural relationship between ER, the head, and the second associ­
                             ate.
                                     The discontinuity that we observe in some comparative sentences also varies

                             with respect to the stranding site (or the extraposition site, in traditional terms) - if
                             one limits oneself to data from English and Spanish, it appears that the second asso­
                             ciate in partial comparison must be stranded at the end of the sentence just as was
                             the case in the full comparisons that we saw above:

                             (241) Juan ate more cookies than tortillas.

                                      However, this is an artifact of object-final word order. Partial comparisons
                             in Spanish and English in which the head is a subject (242)-(243),147or any partial

                             rightward of the second head, even the option for it to appear at the extreme right
                             periphery of the sentence is also available. I call the former option LOCAL STRAND­

                                 147 If the subject is arguably a derived subject, such as in unaccusative constructions, there are
                             other word orders which are more natural. However, examples with deep subjects make the point
                             on their own.
                                 '48 This holds even when the compared constituent is a direct object, due to a phenomenon pre­

                                      We are thus left with the task of explaining why stranding is obligatorily
                             long-distance when it occurs in full comparisons in SLQZ, Spanish and English,
                             but local or long-distance when it occurs in partial comparisons. Whatever propos­
                             al is made should also take into account Kayne’s (1994) Antisymmetry framework,
                             according to which rightward movement is disallowed entirely.

                             3.6 Fronting of ER and the Head in SLQZ
                                      In English and Spanish, the head of the comparison usually occurs in its
                             non-marked sentential position along with ER preceding or following it (cf. §3.2.1
                             for the appropriate word order between ER and the head). Consider the Spanish




                                                                          127

                                      Juan eat.pret.3sg [x.MUCH.f]     pizza
                                      ‘Juan ate pizza’

                                         ‘Juan ate more pizza than me’
                                      I assume that the direct object pizza in (246a) is preceded by the abstract
                             morphemes x.MUCH.f, where x is some pragmatically defined degree such as ‘rel­
                             atively very’. In each case, the morpheme MUCH associated with the direct object
                             is post-verbal regardless of whether it is preceded by a covert Deg (246a), an overt
                             non-comparative Deg (246b),1S0or ER (246c).
                                      In SLQZ, however, the situation is different. In a comparison, the head of
                             a comparison usually occurs in sentence-initial position, along with ER (247), al­
                             though it is also marginally allowed to leave the head and ER in situ (248):
                             (247) Zye:einy-ru’ liebr b-zi:i:i’ Liieb cah Rrodriiegw.
                              MUCH.sol/abs-ER book perf-buy Felipe than Rodrigo
                                    ‘Felipe bought more books than Rodrigo.
                             (248) ?B-zi:i:i’ Liieb     zye:einy-ru’ liebr cah Rrodriiegw.
                                  perf-buy Felipe MUCH.sol/abs-ER book than Rodrigo
                                   ‘Felipe bought more books than Rodrigo’
                                      In non-comparative sentences, a predicative element such as a verb, an ad­
                             jective, or a predicate nominative are fronted to clause-initial position, so it is diffi­
                             cult to compare word order in comparative and non-comparative sentences involv­
                             ing such predicates. However, if we compare comparative sentences in which the
                             head is MUCH, as in (247), with non-comparative sentences in which there is an

                               148 This set of morphemes is covert
                               1501 show in Chapter 4 that mucho audits related forms contain a morpheme ‘very’ plus
                             MUCH and agreement morphemes (gender and number).




                                                                           128

                             indefinite nominal expression, as in (248), we see that there is a difference:
                             (248)           a. B-zi:i:i’ Liieb ra liebr.         [indefinite nominal not fronted)

                                               ‘Felipe bought books’

                                               ‘Felipe bought books’
                                      In (248), the indefinite nominal cannot occupy sentence-initial position but
                             must instead occupy its in situ direct object position.
                                      Note that nominals preceded by overt quantifiers can be and usually are
                             fronted to clause-initial position (249), although they may remain in situ (250):
                             (249)     X:o:on liebr b-zi:i:i’ Liieb.
                                       eight book perf-buy Felipe                 [quantified noun phrase fronted]
                                        ‘Felipe bought 8 books’
                             (250) B-zi:i:i’ Liieb x:o:on liebr.

                                       ‘Felipe bought 8 books’
                                      In fact, (248) apparently does not contain MUCH since the quantified nomi­
                             nal in (251), containing MUCH, can be fronted:
                             (251) Zye:einy liebr b-zi:i:i’ Liieb.
                                MUCH.sol/abs book perf-buy Felipe
                                   ‘Felipe bought 8 books’
                                      Lastly, note that a focussed indefinite may be fronted:
                             (252)     Ra LIEBR      b-zi:i:i’ Liieb.
                                       pi book.foc perf-buy Felipe

                                      Rizzi (1995) proposes an articulated CP in which various properties are

                             jections within a clause. I conclude that in addition to features such as those carried
                             by interrogative elements [+Wh], quantifiers [+Q], and focussed elements [+F], the
                             morpheme ER carries some feature which in SLQZ must be checked by Spellout
                             but is checked after Spellout in English and Spanish. That is why the compared

                             4.0 Review of Data
                                     In Chapter 3, we saw that the morpheme ER appears in an apparently het­
                             erogeneous set of contexts. For example, it may be associated with: (i) MUCH
                             (and its complement nominal) in a comparison of quantity (1), (ii) an adjective or
                             adverb in a comparison of degree (2)-(3), (iii) a verb in a comparison of degree (4)
                             or (iv) a verb in a comparison of extent or frequency (5).

                                     It is desirable to account for the varying properties of the morpheme ER in
                            an explanatory manner rather than just cataloging its superficial functions and mor-
                            phosyntax. This chapter has two principal goals: (i) to give a more uniform se­
                            mantic characterization of ER plus the related second associate as a degree expres­
                            sion, and (ii) to analyze the morphosyntax of ER in the context of degree expres-


                                 1 There is no overt syntactic instance o f MUCH present here - there is no direct syntactic
                            proof of its presence since SLQZ extent MUCH is always covert (in both comparative and non­
                            comparative sentences). That is, SLQZ uses a construction (i) parallel to the construction in
                            Spanish involving post-verbal mucho (ii):
                                 (i) R -caa’z-[ )-daa:a’n Liieb na:a’.
                                     hab-love-MUCH-very Fdipe lsg
                                       ‘Felipe loves me very much’
                                 (ii) Felipe me         quiere mucho-[].
                                      Felipe lsg.acc love.3sg very-MUCH
                                      ‘Felipe loves me very much’
                                 In each case, only the morpheme meaning ‘vary’ —-daa:a’n in SLQZ and mucho in Spanish —
                            is overt. I justify this analysis of mucho below and in §4.2.2.3.
                                 1 assume that there actually is a syntactic instance of MUCH here (or some other extent or fre­
                            quency adverbial understood from the context) and in the type of sentence in (5). Cf. §4.13 for
                            further discussion of the verbal extent adverbial MUCH.
                                 2 Since this sentence can also mean ‘Rodrigo runs more q u ic k ly than Felipe’ or “Rodrigo
                            runs fu rth e r than Felipe’, the structure could actually contain a covert adverbial quickly or far
                            rather than MUCH. This is determined by the discourse context.




                                                                            132

                             4.1 The Function Performed by ER
                                     In Chapter 3 ,1 introduced two interrelated notions. One is a semantic no­
                             tion - the compared property. This is the common property that each of two enti­
                             ties, the terms of the comparison, hold but to potentially different degrees.
                                     The other notion is a syntactic one —the head of the comparison. I defined
                             this element loosely as the element most intimately tied to ER In traditional termi­
                             nology, this element is usually taken to be a lexical item.
                                     In this section, I propose a unique semantic domain for ER: degree compar­
                            isons. This unification is possible via a close look at the identity of the compared
                             property across comparisons of various head-types.
                                     Then, in the second part of the chapter, I will review various proposals as to
                             the actual structures involved in degree modification in general - Bresnan (1973),
                            Jackendoff (1977), Corver (1997), and Rijkhoek (in progress) - accepting none en­
                            tirely but selecting elements of each for the final proposal.

                            4.1.1 Degree comparisons: adjectives and adverbs
                                     Without yet providing a justification for doing so, I nevertheless take the
                            case of ER used with compared adjectives and adverbs to be the general case.
                            Recall from Chapter 3 that I claim ER to be the head of a constituent which as a
                             whole denotes a semantic degree.
                                     Thus, in sentences such as (2) and (3), repeated here for convenience, ER is
                             used to compare the degree to which a given property holds of various individuals
                             or events, respectively:

                                      In (2), the degree to which Juan is intelligent is compared to the degree to
                             which Josd is intelligent. In (3), the degree to which Rodrigo runs quickly is com­
                             pared to the degree to which Felipe runs quickly, or alternatively, we can say that
                             the degree to which Rodrigo’s running (an event) is quick is being compared to the
                             degree to which Felipe’s running is quick.

                             4.1.2 Amount comparisons and nouns: a reanalysis of the traditional notion
                                      When we make a comparison such as in (1), repeated below, we are com­
                             paring amounts of a certain type of object, which Pinkham (1982) refers to as a
                             KIND:

                                               ‘Rodrigo bought more books than Felipe’
                                      Mathematically, we are comparing the cardinalities of two sets, in this case:
                             (i) the set of books that Rodrigo bought, and (ii) the set of books that Felipe
                             bought. We are certainly not, however, comparing degrees of “bookness”, i.e.,


                                  3 Recall from Chapter 3 that I take MUCH to be an abstract element which usually surfaces
                             together with noun class agreement (essentially, count vs. noun) as much or many in English and
                             zyeieiny andzr:t ’lly in SLQZ. As we will see below, however, in Spanish it only surfaces as part
                             of a degree expression that it has incorporated to such as mucho (which I take to be an allomorph
                             of muy ‘very’ - Cf. §4.2.23), demasiado, cuanto, etc.




                                                                            134

                                      One option is to simply accept that comparisons either involve degree, as in
                             the case of compared adjectives and adverbs, or quantity, as in the case of amount
                             comparisons.4
                                      However, amount comparisons can be reinterpreted as comparisons of de­
                             gree, as long as we claim that ER plus its second associate together express the de­
                             gree to which a quantity is large, or more abstractly, that the degree denoted by ER
                             and the corresponding second associate merely marks the extension of a quantity
                             along the positively-oriented scale of numerical values. Recasting the above de­
                             scription of (1) in these terms, we can say that what is being compared is the degree
                             to which [the books that Rodrigo bought are many] with the degree to which [the
                             books that Felipe bought are many].
                                      I pause here to emphasize, basing myself on Rivara (1990), that the abstract
                             element MUCH, manifested along with number agreement as many or much in
                             English, for example, is used in comparisons only to indicate that the property in
                             question is the numerical scale and that that the orientation is positive, not to imply
                             that the cardinality of either set of items is large in absolute terms. Therefore, the
                             use of the word many in my paraphrase of (1) is not the same as the use of many in
                             (6), where there is an understood degree associated with MUCH with an interpreta­
                             tion similar to ‘relatively very’.5 Rather, the element MUCH in (1) functions like
                             the English word many in (7), which simply designates the numerical scale as the
                             relevant gradable property, with positive orientation:
                             (6)    Juan bought many books.
                             [roughly = Juan bought relatively very many books.]


                                  * This is not even a hypothetical option given my glosses. I chose to give consistent glosses
                             throughout, despite their lack of theoretical neutrality. Nevertheless, the argument in the text is
                             reasonable under an a priori reasonable alternate gloss without the presence of the abstract mor­
                             pheme MUCH.
                                  5 Cf. Galant (1998) for a more in-depth discussion of English many and Spanish mucho vis-a-
                             vis the abstract element MUCH, which I referred to there as MANY instead.

                                 8 The suffix -ta' is not always the element used to translate English too (nor does it always
                            mean ‘too’). For example, sometimes, the element -daa:a’n ‘very’ is used to translate English
                            too instead. The point is that zye:einy is analogous to English many in that it means ‘relatively
                            very MUCH’ when used alone, but merely represents a positive amount when used in conjunction
                            with a Deg.
                                 7 There is a way of asking ‘how many’ using zye:einy (i), but this is not a true request for in­
                            formation but rather a (potentially incredulous) reaction to a previous assertation that there are rela­
                            tively many of some kind of object, i.e., ‘How very many are there ?’

                                      I will assume that dya’ / tya’ are variants of MUCH, also contained in
                             zye:einy and zi:i’Uy■10
                                      As for Spanish, I propose that muchos and muchas are not the equivalent of
                             English many but rather, the equivalent of English very many, and in the same way,
                             mucho and mucha are the equivalent of English very much (not much). I justify
                             this based on the following:
                                      (i)       The word muy, which means ‘very’, can surface as mucho when in
                                                isolation (e.g., in a truncated answer to a question):
                                                        Q:       i Estds (muy/* mucho) cansada ?
                                                                  be.2sg     very          tired
                                                                  ‘Are you very tired ?’
                                                         A:        Sf, mucho / *muy.
                                                                   yes very
                                                                   ‘Yes, very’
                                      (ii)      The word mucho appears with gender and number agreement only
                                                when preceding and quantifying a noun phrase. I assume that gen­
                                                der and number agreement signal the presence of MUCH.
                                      (iii)     The words muy I mucho cannot be associated with a Deg, other than
                                                with itself (vs. much / many in English and zye:einy, zi-'i’lly, and
                                  8 Munro,Lopez, etal. (inpreparation) translate te’ihbyzagreentya’ as ‘this much’ or ‘this
                             many’, apparently treating te’ihbyzagreen as one morpheme ‘this’. Nevertheless, since the initial
                             string te ’i ’hby was optional in the data that I elicited and otherwise has its own meaning ‘one’, I
                             treat it as a separate morpheme.
                                  10P a m e la M u n r o claims (p.c.) that dya’ I tya’ are expressions of extent. Thus, perhaps they
                             contain MUCH plus some other material. I will take them to simply be manifestation of MUCH
                             for this dissertation, acknowledging nonetheless that more precision may be needed.




                                                                               137

                                               dya’ / tya’ in SLQZ, which I claim do not contain a Deg). The word
                                               mucho only turns up in cases like (6), never in cases like (7).11 That
                                               is, mucho does not generally appear in Spanish sentences equivalent
                                               to English sentences in which many or much is preceded by a Deg.
                                               This is because mucho already contains the Deg muy / mucho.
                                      In (11), muchos appears without any preceding Deg:

                                      No Deg may precede muchos:

                                      Instead, in order to express the notion of Deg plus MUCH, a Deg appears
                             with number and gender agreement(14a)-(14f),13 or a partitive construction with
                             de is used (15a)-(15d):

                                              ‘Juan bought as many books as me’


                                  " The overt morphology in the sentence in (14f) does not transparently rule out the presence
                             of the element mucho, but I claim the morhological composition given in the gloss, which ex­
                             cludes the morpheme muy / mucho ‘very’.
                                  12 I assume that there is a covert instance of MUCH present in this sentence and any other
                             type o f sentence in which a Deg with agreement precedes a noun in Spanish —this covert MUCH
                             is not cleady associated with any overt morpheme, so use square brackets to show its presence, and
                             I gloss instances of Deg plus MUCH plus agreement as in (i):
                                  (i) Deg-MUCH-gender-number                 [1 omit number if it is singular]
                                  13 The Deg muylmucho follows this pattern, too. Cf. (11).

                                     Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that mucho plus agreement in number and
                            gender is in fact the Spanish equivalent to very many.
                                     Thus English many and much, when preceded by an overt Deg expression
                            or when contained in the word more, have the following counterparts: zye:einy,
                            zi:i’lly, and -tya’ / -dya’ in SLQZ and a covert morpheme MUCH whose presence
                            is signalled by number and gender agreement in SLQZ. In Spanish, the default in­
                            terpretation of relatively very many cannot be manifested as mere number and gen­
                            der agreement, since these are bound morphemes. Therefore, mucho ‘very’ must
                            be overtly realized along with gender and number agreement in sentences in which a
                            default relatively very many interpretation is desired.



                                 14 In case of mds, I do not attempt to show any correlation between its component morphemes
                            and their phonological m a n ife s ta tio n s since suppletion is at work here.




                                                                          139

                            4.1.3    Verbal comparisons

                            4.1.3.1 A reinterpretation of the semantics
                                     In those comparisons in which the head would traditionally be identified as
                            a verb, the comparison being made may involve the degree to which various indi­
                            viduals hold the property described by the verb or the extent to which they perform
                            the action described by the verb. For example, in (4), repeated here, what is being
                            compared is the degree to which the individuals Felipe and Rodrigo each love the
                            speaker.15

                                             [ambiguous: Rodrigo = subj. or obj.]
                                     b.       Felipe me       quiere        mas a        mf que Rodrigo.

                                              [not ambiguous: R = subj.]
                                     In (5), however, the property being compared could not somehow be the
                            degree to which each athlete runs, since that would not make any sense, but rather,
                            the extent (i.e., the distance or the duration) to which, or frequency with which,
                            they each run:

                                             ‘Rodrigo runs more than Felipe’
                                     The following paraphrases illustrate each of these possible interpretations,
                            respectively:
                            (16)    a.        Rodrigo corre mtis lejos que Felipe.
                                              Rodrigo run.3sg ER far that Felipe
                                              ‘Rodrigo runs farther than Felipe’
                                 15 (4a) also has an alternative reading, in which Felipe loves Rodrigo instead. This reading is
                            not relevant to the point at hand.

                                      In cases such as (5), the actual head of the comparison is not the verb but
                             instead, some covert element, such as abstract extent MUCH, an adverb or indefi­

                                      Up until this point, I have assumed that the default identity of 0 is MUCH
                             (Cf. gloss of (5)), although it may be that in any given case, it may be understood
                             based on the discourse context as ‘often’, ‘far’, etc. Some specific examples fol­
                             low.
                                      In (21), for example,    0   might represent number of hours or frequency (in
                             the case of naps):
                             (21)    a.       Felipe duerme mds 0 que til.
                                                Felipe sleep.3sg ER [ ] that 2sg.nom
                                               ‘Felipe sleeps more [hours/often] than you’
                                      b.     R-a’ihsy-0 -ru’     Felipe cah liru’w.

                                              ‘Felipe sleeps more [hours/often] than you’
                                      In the following example, 0 might represent number of letters or articles, or
                             frequency of writing.
                             (22)    a.       Felipe escribe mds 0 que tu.
                                              Felipe write.3sg ER [ ] that 2sg.nom
                                               ‘Felipe writes more [letters/often] than you’
                                      b.      R-cwa:a:a’-0 -ru’ Felipe cah li:u’w.
                                              hab-write-[ ]-ER Felipe than 2sg
                                               ‘Felipe writes more [letters/often] than you’

                                       Even the sentence in (4) can be paraphrased in such a way that what is
                             being compared is the degree to which a predicate other than the verb, such as in­
                             tensity or depth, holds of propositions:
                             (4’)     Felipe loves me more deeply than Rodrigo.

                             4.1.3.2 Verbal extent comparisons - conclusion
                                      Many verbs are not gradable in and of themselves. In most cases, a sen­
                             tence involving what appears to be a directly graded verb actually involves the grad­
                             ing of some other, often covert, predicate. This latter predicate is generally a predi­
                             cate of state (sometimes predicated on an event).




                                                                           142

                            mantic characterization of ER. It is, however, the one I will adopt In the next sec­
                            tion, I will reconcile my claim about the semantic nature of ER (i.e., that compari­
                            son is always of degree) with the facts about its syntactic distribution and morpho­
                            logical behavior in both amount comparisons (which are according to my analysis
                            actually a type of degree comparison) and adjectival degree comparisons.

                             4.2 Reconciling the Function and Behavior of ER
                                      Here I outline what previous studies have claimed about the syntax of ER
                             and related Deg’s and degree expressions, based mainly on the facts of English.
                             Then I measure how each fares in the light of relevant data, both data already pub­
                             lished as well as new data, such as in Spanish and SLQZ. Finally, I propose my
                             own degree framework based on the merits of these proposals.
                                     Although I present critiques of these previous works, I am in fact quite in­
                             debted to the immense groundwork they have laid both in grouping relevant data in
                             a useful fashion and in calling attention to many of the crucial issues that must be
                             dealt with in any adequate analysis of the data.

                             4.2.1 Previous work
                                     In this section, I will present four previous proposals regarding the syntax
                             of ER in relation to the syntax of degree expressions in general, both in the adjecti­
                             val system as well as in the nominal system.
                                     The first two of these proposals are from the 1970’s. Bresnan’s (1973)
                             widely-encompassing work on complementation in general includes a detailed treat­
                             ment of degree expressions and comparatives. Jackendoff’s (1977) work on X’-
                             structure contains, among other things, a critique of Bresnan involving a bifurcation
                             between the adjectival and nominal system with respect to degree modification.
                                     The third and fourth works are much more recent. Corver (1997) recasts
                             Bresnan’s and Jackendoff’s proposals in terms compatible with both the functional
                             head analysis and Chomsky’s (1993) Minimalist program. He readopts Bresnan’s
                             position that degree modification between the nominal and adjectival system is par­
                             allel, explaining away apparent differences in terms of minimalist motivations.
                             Rijkhoek (in progress) agrees with Corver for the most part but differs with Corver
                             regarding the morphological structure of certain Deg’s including ER and degree ex­
                             pressions.

                             4.2.1.1 Bresnan (1973)16
                                      Bresnan proposes a single degree schema for both nominal and adjectival
                             constructions. As part of her proposal, she claims that “partitives or quantifiers
                             occur on adjectives and adverbs as well as nouns” (p.276). Basing herself on this
                             claim, Bresnan concludes that “underlying every comparative is a partitive or quan-
                             tifier-like element much, many, little, or fe w ” (p.276). Bresnan admits (p.276) that
                             “it may seem odd to propose that” the adjectival and nominal systems function in
                             such a similar fashion, and yet she is motivated, among other things, by parallel be­
                             havior such as in the following phrases (pp. 280, her examples #24a-c):
                             (23)      adjectival system         nominal system
                                      a bit long                 a bit of rope
                                      an inch long               an inch of rope
                                      long enough                enough rope
                                      I provide below Bresnan’s general degree schema but with the following
                             modifications:17

                                      According to Bresnan (p.277), the elements which may occupy the position
                             she calls Det but which I call Deg include as, too, that, so, and ER, whereas the Q

                                 17 Note that Bresnan takes elements like ER, too, etc. to be Det’s rather than Deg’s.

                            position may be occupied by much, many, little, few , or enough, with the proviso
                             (p.286) that enough must select an empty Deg (Det in her terms).18 Although she
                            does not say so, it must also be assumed that many and few are not viable choices
                            for Q in adjectival comparisons nor in nominal comparisons involving mass nouns.
                            This selectional restriction is presumably due to the fact that only count nouns bear
                            the necessary features to select for many and few. The CP projection shown as
                            complement of Deg houses the second associate of the comparison, introduced in
                            English by either than or as, and Bresnan assumes that this CP is extraposed. I will
                            ignore the presence of the second associate for the moment, delaying a discussion
                            of its syntax until Chapter 5.
                                     The degree modified nominals seem to conform fairly well to Bresnan’s
                            system, although the cases where either Q = enough or Deg = ER are not as simple
                            as the others. I put these two cases aside for the moment but will take them up once
                            more in a joint discussion of both nominal and adjectival degree expressions. For
                            now, I present the following examples of phrases which fit Bresnan’s model readi­
                            ly:
                            (25)     [NP   [QP    [DegP that ] many ] books]]]
                            (26)     [NP   [QP    [DegP as ] much ] water ]]]
                            (27)     [NP   [QP    [DegP so ] few ] books]]]
                            (28)     [NP   [QP    [DegP too ] little ] patience ]]]
                            In each of these structures, a Deg heads DegP, located in SpecQP, which in turn oc­
                            cupies specNP.
                                     The adjectival system is somewhat problematic at first glance. Limiting the
                            discussion initially to those cases parallel to the nominal cases discussed immediate­
                            ly above, we see that most adjectives are never preceded by an overt copy of much
                            or little:19

                                1®Note that Bresnan is only concerned with the Det status of these elements and does not ad­
                            dress the fact that the second associate denotes a degree in concert with the Det’s concerned here.
                                101 discuss below some adjectives which may be preceded by much or little. No adjectives
                            may be modified by many or few, since only the presence of plural number (found only on plural
                            nouns) can give rise to these forms.

                                     Although Bresnan does not mention this, most adjectives may not be pre­
                             ceded by much or little if Deg is null, either

                                     Bresnan presents two alternatives at this point regarding the morphological
                             makeup of more (pp.278):
                             Alternative I: “more does not derive from er much, er many, or it derives from
                             these forms everywhere except before adjectives and adverbs.”
                             Alternative 2: “more does derive from er much, er many everywhere in deep
                             structure, but there is a rule deleting much obligatorily when it modifies adjectives
                             and adverbs.”
                                     Bresnan chooses to support the second alternative, and in order to account
                             for the absence of much in front of adjectives (and adverbs), she proposes the fol­
                             lowing rule:
                             (35)    Rule of Much Deletion
                             [Bresnan’s #10]
                             much—>0 [..._____ Aa p ], where A(P) = Adjective or Adverb (Phrase)

                                     In fact, Bresnan does point out three cases where much does occur in front
                             of adjectives or adjectival slots: (i) when much is used to indicate extent of separa­
                             tion in degrees, i.e. how much more / how much less something is the case, in
                             what I call a differential comparative construction, (ii) in front of the exceptional ad­
                             jectives alike and different, and (iii) within a compared measure phrase. All of
                             these are exemplified and discussed below.
                                     Differential comparative constructions are exemplified in (36):

                                      In this type of comparison, there is an overt element which indicates, either
                             precisely or only vaguely, the difference in degree that the two terms of the compar­
                             ison hold the relevant property.
                                      It has been claimed elsewhere, e.g., Corver (1997),20that such an instance
                             of much is actually different than the type of much which Bresnan claims to be pre­
                             sent in Q. If there is an instance of much in Q in Bresnan’s scheme, it modifies an
                             adjective or noun, whereas the much of the examples in (36) must modify ER or
                             ER plus an adjective or noun. Therefore, such examples do not in and of them­
                             selves support the claim that non-compared adjectives are preceded by a deleted
                             much.
                                      As for the exceptional adjectives alike and different, Bresnan claims that the
                             rule of Much Deletion is optional for them:
                             Exceptional adjectives (Bresnan, fn#4)
                             (37) a.       A tangerine isn’t as (much) different from an orange as I’d thought.
                                    b.     You and I are as (much) alike as a horse and a cow.
                                      Note, however, that even Bresnan comments that these adjectives are inher­
                             ently comparative, and hence, could subcategorize for a QP in a manner analogous
                             to differential comparative constructions, without others adjectives being able to do
                             so. The following data show that such inherent adjectives behave syntically more
                             like compared adjectives than simple adjectives [Bresnan’s examples, fn#4, last two
                             examples mine]:
                             (38)            comparative                         non-comparative
                             not any different     not any taller                *not any tall
                             so much different     so much taller                *so much tall
                             not anything alike
                             so much alike
                                      Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that different and alike can behave either
                             as simple adjectives or as compared adjectives. In the former case, they cannot be

                             modified by much or not any, whereas in the latter case, they can.21 Note that in
                             cases where different and alike behave as inherently compared adjectives, it is the
                             degree of difference or similarity which is marked by much or not any(thing) . This
                             case is antilogous to differential comparatives constructions, except that here, the
                             comparisons are qualitative rather than quantitative. That is, it is a matter of overall
                             difference of identity or equality of identity, rather than a matter of possessing a
                             given property to a different or equal degree.
                                      Not surprisingly, different and alike also admit modification by little, some­
                             thing which most other adjectives disallow:22
                             [Bresnan, fn#3]
                             (39) This year’s model is little different from last year’s .
                                    You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow.
                                      These instances of different and alike, respectively, represent the inherently
                             comparative variant of each.
                                      Lastly, I turn to Bresnan’s examples involving compared measure phrases:
                             Compared measure phrases [=Bresnan’s #22-#23]
                             (40) a.     John is more than 6 feet tall, [no Much Deletion]
                                   b.    John is taller than 6 feet      [Much Deletion, Rules for Simple
                                                                               Comparisons]
                             (41)    a.       These plants may grow as much as 6 feet high.
                                              [no Much Deletion]
                                      b.      These plants may grow as high as 6 feet.
                                              [Much Deletion]
                                      In the (a) examples, much is not left-string-adjacent to an adjective, so it is
                             not deleted. The (b) examples, on the other hand, undergo loss of much - in (40b),
                             much is lost via Rules for Simple Comparisons (removal of more before syntheti­
                             cally-compared adjectives such as tall - see discussion below) and in (41b), much

                                 2' The only difference is that alike can only be modified by not anything rather than by not
                             any. I do not have an explanation for this slight difference.
                                 22 Corver (1997) points out that there are non-comparative adjectives which do allow little and
                             much modification but that may argued to be semi-verbal in nature:
                                 (i) He is little afraid of what you might do.
                                 (ii) She feels very much relaxed today.




                                                                             150

                            is lost via Much Deletion.
                                     I think that Bresnan does convincingly show through (40) and (41) that
                            high may be modified by a QP. Moreover, if one takes more to always come from
                            either many + ER or much + ER, then Bresnan has also demonstrated that tall may
                            be modified by a QP. Even so, I do not believe this holds for all adjectives. In par­
                             ticular, this only holds for adjectives which allow modification by a measure phrase
                            in general, e.g., high, tall, long, wide, old, thick, early, late and broad. Compare
                            their behavior with other adjectives which are also semantically compatible with a
                            numerical measurement but which do not allow the cooccurrence of adjective plus
                            measure phrase:
                            Ability to admit measure phrase
                                    a.     This log is five inches thick.
                                    b.     *This log is 100 lbs. heavy.
                                    b’     This log weighs 100 lbs.
                                    b .”   This log is heavy.
                                     a.      My sister is 26 years old.
                                     b.      *My sister drives 100 mph fast.
                                     b .’    My sister drives 100 mph.
                                     b.”     My sister drives fast.
                                     In (42b), the adjective heavy cannot be preceded by a measure phrase even
                            though the very similar adjective thick in (42a) can. Instead, a verbal paraphrase
                            must be used, as in (42b’), or a more general statement with the bare adjective may
                            be used, as in (42b” ), with loss of meaning. Similarly, although old allows modi­
                            fication by a measure phrase (43a), fast does not (43b) and only alternative con­
                            structions are allowed (43b’) and (43b”).
                                     We saw a variation of word order in (40)-(41) taken from Bresnan. Once
                            again, thick allows this variation in word order (44), but heavy does not (45), just
                            as old does (46) whereas fast does not (47):
                            Ability to exhibit variation shown in 1401-1411
                            (44) a.         Some logs are as much as five inches thick,
                                    b.      Some logs are as thick as five inches.




                                                                         151

                                      In fact, even an adjective from the above list may not allow a measure
                             phrase in the non-comparative case in every usage, even if the comparative form
                             does. Thus, high cannot be preceded by a measure phrase when physical height or
                             altitude is not at stake (48a) and (49a), not even if the measure phrase contains ei­
                             ther ER (48) or EG (49b), whereas the comparative forms higher (48c) and as
                             high (9c) can be followed by a measure phrase:
                             (48)     a.       *My sister’s IQ is 150 ((IQ) points) high.

                                      We will see in §4.2.1.2 that Jackendoff chooses to mark adjectives such as
                             different and alike, on the one hand, and high, long, etc., on the other, in the lexi­
                             con as members of one of two classes of exceptional adjectives, respectively, in that
                             the first of these two classes of adjectives admits much and little modification, and
                             the second allows measure phrase modification. This removes the need to claim
                             that all adjectives can be modified by a QP.
                                      Assume for the moment, though, that Bresnan is correct in claiming that all


                                  23 The difficulty in using years in this second variant may be related to a pragmatic factor —the
                             fact that most people give their ages in years. If the discourse universe were limited to a group of
                             infants, then usage of the unit months, as opposed to years, is actually quite good in a sentence
                             analogous to the one above in which years is not allowed.

                             adjectives are or can be modified by QP’s, and that her Much Deletion rule ade­
                             quately controls the presence or absence of much. Note that although this would
                             account successfully for the data in (40)-(41), there are two difficulties that such a
                             proposal encounters. First of all, it is ad hoc: it successfully corrects the ungram­
                             matical strings containing much, but there is no other motivation provided for such
                             a rule. Secondly, this rule does nothing to explain why little may not appear in
                             front of an adjective. As Jackendoff (1977) points out, a deletion rule analogous to
                             (35) will not work, since the meaning of little would not be recoverable from the
                             bare adjective remaining after a hypothetical rule of Little Deletion.
                                      One could hypothesize that the inability of little to appear before adjectives is
                             an English-specific problem - languages such as Spanish and French do allow an
                             element similar to little before adjectives, namely poco and peu, respectively:
                             (42)     Juan     es        poco       inteligente.
                                      Juan be.3sg NEG.very intelligent
                                      ‘Juan is not very intelligent’
                             (43)     Jean est        peu         intelligent.
                                      Jeanbe.3sg NEG.very intelligent
                                      ‘Jean is not very intelligent’
                                      However, consider the glosses I have provided here for poco and peu. -
                             they do not include the element much. I take poco to consist of some negative ele­
                             ment NEG plus muy / mucho ‘very’ and peu to consist of NEG plus tres ‘very’.
                             The difference between English on the one hand and Spanish and French, on the
                             other, can be reconciled by simply claiming that Spanish and French conflate the
                             two morphemes expressed in English not very into a single word. As for the
                             English words little and few , I take them to consist of not only NEG and very but
                             also MUCH and number agreement, the key issue being the presence of MUCH.
                             Since non-exceptional adjectives do not have a Q slot, they cannot be preceded by
                             MUCH, which is contained in little. Therefore, non-exceptional adjectives cannot
                             be preceded by little. Exceptional adjectives such as different, on the other hand,




                                                                           153

                             do subcategorize for a Q slot and hence can be preceded by little.
                                      As for both adjectival and nominal comparisons of inequality, Bresnan as­
                             sumes that ER is a Det, generated in a position which I call Deg, and either much or
                             little, when the head of the comparison is an adjective or a mass noun, or many or
                            few , when the head of the comparison is a count noun, is generated in Q. Howev­
                             er, as Bresnan points out, we do not get the expected surface strings:
                             (44)     *-er much bread, *-er little bread, *-er many people
                             (45)     *-er much tired, *-er little tired, *-er much toll
                                      This is true even after Much Deletion has occurred, in the case of adjectival
                             comparisons:
                             (46)     *-er tired, (*-er little tired,) *-er tall
                                      Bresnan proposes a rule which I will call ER Encliticization, by which the
                             Deg ERis suffixed onto Q (i.e., much, many, little, few):
                             (47)     Rule of ER Encliticization          [Bresnan’s #20]

                                                        >

                             -er               much.               0      much, + er
                                               etc.                       etc.

                                      Subsequently, the resulting complex word is subject to Suppletion /
                             Spelling Rules (48) in order to transform the ungrammatical forms in (49a) and
                             (49b) into the grammatical forms in (50a) and (50b), respectively:
                             (4S)24 much + ER —>more
                                    many + ER —>more
                                    little + ER —> less
                             (49)     a.      *mucher bread, *littler bread, *manyer people                             —>
                                      b.      *mucher tired, *littler tired, *mucher tall                               —>


                                  z4These rules are adapted from Bresnan’s #7. The version that she gives is formulated in terms
                             of the strings present before encliticization has taken place, but I will assume that enclisis of ER
                             always takes place and then rules of Suppledon I Spelling Rules take effect on the resulting
                             strings.




                                                                             154

                                      Note that Bresnan’s rule of ER Encliticization precedes her rule of Much
                             Deletion and hences bleeds it
                                      A problem arises in the case of those adjectives (most of the monosyllables
                             and some of the disyllables) which are said to have a synthetic comparative (cf.
                             Chapter 3). For example, with the rules stated thus far, we would expect (51) as
                             the spell-out form of the last example in (50), but instead, we get (52):
                             (51)     *more tall
                             (52)     taller
                                      Bresnan alludes to Rules for Simple Comparatives in a morphological
                             derivation of forms such as taller (part of Bresnan’s #21),26 although she never
                             spells out such rules in words. Essentially, what these rules do is: (i) copy ER
                             onto an adjective following much + ER, and then (ii), delete much + ER. The rule
                             successfully handles the data, although the mechanism is not clear, nor is there any
                             motivation other than simply to account for the data

                                  25 See discussion immediately below for Bresnan’s treatment of such cases.
                                  28 Bresnan points out (1979, endnote #5) that the Rules for Simple Comparatives only occur
                             within an AP, such as in the following type of sentences (1979, p314, no numbers given to any
                             of these examples):
                                       Case A
                                       (i)     John is angrier than he is sad.
                                       (ii)    The door is longer than the table is wide.
                                  If however, the comparison is an epistemic comparison, as in (iii), then Bresnan’s Rules for
                             Simple Comparatives are not allowed (cf. (iv)):
                                       CaseB
                                       (iii)   John is more angry than sad (=John is angry, more than sad)
                                       (iv)    *John is angrier than sad.
                                  That Case A involves a different type of comparison than Case B is supported by the fact that
                             they display other differences in behavior as well.
                                  As Bresnan points out, for example, in the true adjectival degree comparison (in her terms,
                             when the degree is within AP), i.e., in Case A, the two adjectives used must be compatible (i.e.,
                             an individual must be capable of holding both properties to some degree simultaneously), as can be
                             seen in the ungrammatical sentence in (v), whereas if the degree is within VP instead i.e., in Case
                             B, the adjectives need not be compatible (vi):
                                       (v)     *1 would say that John is taller than he is short.
                                       (vi)    I would say that John is more tall than short.




                                                                            155

                                     Even though there is an extra complication involved with synthetically-
                             formed adjectival comparisons, Bresnan’s proposed degree schema combined with
                             ER Encliticization and suppletion rules is nonetheless able to correctly rule out the
                             following ungrammatical forms:
                             (53)    *as more, *too more, *that more, *so more, *as less, *too less,
                                           *that less, *so less
                                     The second word in each of these phrases contains ER as a subelement,
                             which is base-generated in the same position needed by the degree element occur­
                             ring as the first word in each form, namely Deg.

                             Enough
                                   A discussion of Bresnan’s account of the properties of enough is relevant
                            here, too, since she claims that similar behavior between enough and more further
                            justifies her choice of Alternative 2 above.
                                     Bresnan proposes (p.286) that enough is a Q selecting an obligatorily null
                            Det (Deg in my terms). This selectional requirement is necessary to rule out the
                            otherwise anticipated forms in (54):27
                             (54)    *as enough, *too enough, *that enough, *so enough, *enougher
                                     The claim that enough is generated in Q also correctly rules out the forms in
                             (55), since the first word in each example is also claimed to be generated in Q.28
                            However, this claim also incorrectly rules out the forms in (56), which should be
                             ruled out for the same reason as (55). In fact, Bresnan does not provide any means
                             for allowing the data in (56).
                             (55)    *much enough, *many enough, *enough much, *enough many,
                                           *enough few, *enough little

                                 27 One might use semantic grounds to justify the selectional properties of enough and in that
                            way rule out the forms in (54). Note that none of the forms given here have any coherent interpre­
                            tation.
                                 28 Bresnan suggests in fn#12, that forms such as *much enough and *many enough may be
                            ruled out by selectional requirements, although her schema placing enough as a Q already seems to
                            rule out these ungrammatical forms solely due to the competition of much / many and enough for
                            the same slot.




                                                                           156

                             (56)      few enough, little enough29
                                       The word enough actually necessitates another rule, in Bresnan’s proposed
                             as well as in any of the other three that I will be presenting.30 The exact formulation
                             of this rule varies, but the necessity of such a rule in one shape or another is clear.
                             Consider the following data:
                             (57)    a.        Tomds bought enough soup for all of us.
                                     b.        Tomds bought soup enough for all of us.
                                               [poetic or right-dislocation]

                                     The word enough must obligatorily follow an adjective that it modifies,
                             even though Bresnan’s account holds that it is base-generated to the left of the ad­
                             jective that it modifies. To generate the correct surface strings, Bresnan proposes a
                             rule of Enough Permutation as in (60):
                             (60)    enough X —> X enough
                                     According to Bresnan, this rule is optional with nouns (cf. (57)), but obli­
                             gatory with any other “constituent it modifies if that constituent has no intervening
                             determiner” (p.285). What Bresnan means by “an intervening determiner” is any
                             element sitting in Deg or a determiner, such as a, an, the, these, etc., in front of a
                             noun.31
                                     This rule correctly accounts for (59a) vs. (59b), but there is still no explana-

                                  28 The expressions few enough and little enough involve the modification of the quantifiers
                            few and little, respectively, by enough, and not vice-versa. This is feasible given the rule of
                             Enough Permutation given below, whatever its correct formulation may be, as long as we generate
                             enough as aDeg (Det in Bresnan’s terms) instead of as a Q.
                                  30 Rijkhoek (in progress) does not mention this rule, but I assume that her account of the dis­
                             tribution of degree expressions needs a rule of this type to explain the placement of enough.
                                  31 The interested reader is invited to refer to Bresnan (1973) for data in which a determiner in­
                             tervenes between enough and a noun and hence blocks Enough Permutation.

                             tion for the grammaticality of (56) since for Bresnan, few and little are Q’s just like
                             enough. This objection notwithstanding, Bresnan’s rule of Enough Permutation
                             does provide a way of maintaining that enough is generated as a Q, both before
                             nouns and adjectives. She argues that since one Q, namely, enough, may be gener­
                             ated pre-adjectivally, then much should be able to be generated pre-adjectivally, too.
                                      Another parallel between enough and much involves a phenomenon which
                             Bresnan calls AP Shift. Consider the following:
                             (61)    a.       Juan is too boring a teacher [for me to take his class],
                                     b.       *Juan is a too boring teacher [for me to take his class].
                             (62)    a.       Juan is so boring a teacher [that I fall asleep in his class every time],
                                      b.      *Juan is a so boring teacher [that I fall asleep in his class
                                                       every time].
                             (63)    a.       ?Juan is more boring a teacher than I am.
                                      b.      Juan is a more boring teacher than I am.
                             (64)    a.       ?Juan is boring enough a teacher [for me to fall asleep in his class],
                                      b.      Juan is a boring enough teacher [for me to fall asleep in his class].
                                     Bresnan assumes that an adnominal AP (such as too boring in the string
                             too boring a teacher) is base-generated as a left-sister to the nominal that it modifies
                             (e.g., a teacher) - roughly, what I take to be a DP. Bresnan does not consider cases
                             where AP is not modified by any overt degree, so I will leave that case aside.
                             There are two cases, then, to deal with.
                                     First, there are those AP’s which are modified by a QP containing an overt
                             Deg, such as in (61) and (62). In such cases, AP shift does not occur. This can be
                             seen by the grammatical (a) examples, in which the quantified AP precedes the de­
                             terminer / noun complex, and the ungrammatical (b) examples, in which the quanti­
                             fied AP follows the determiner but precedes the noun.
                                     Secondly, there are those AP’s which are modified by a QP which does not
                             contain a overt Deg. Bresnan takes this to be the case in both (63) and (64), since
                             the manifestation of more instead of much signifies for her the removal of ER from




                                                                          158

                             Deg, having left behind an empty Deg, and sineeenough selects for a (base-generat­
                             ed) null Deg in the first place. In such cases, AP Shift usually takes place.32
                                      AP Shift consists of two steps (although there can be more in cases of re­
                             cursive degree or adjectival modification). First, a QP with a null Deg is base-gen­
                             erated in what I assume is specAP, although Bresnan does not label this site
                             specAP. Then, AP moves into some position between the determiner and the noun.
                             Once again, Bresnan does not specify the landing site.
                                      Although some of the mechanism involved here is not entirely clear, the fact
                             that enough and more (as well as less) seem to behave as a unified class is taken as
                             support for the claim that enough, much, and little are the same type of element

                            The OP / AP system and recursiveness
                                      Up until now, the discussion has been limited to degree modification of ad­
                            jectives and nominals. Bresnan notes that it is also possible (i) for adjectives to
                             modify other adjectives in adverb guise, (ii) for QP’s to modify other QP’s, and (iii)
                            for adjectives to modify quantifiers. Furthermore, these relationships are all recur­
                            sive. Examples of each along with comments and structures proposed by Bresnan
                            follow.

                             fit adjectives modifying other adjectives in adverb guise
                                      Basing herself on Emonds (1970), Bresnan (p.291) claims that “most ad­
                            verbs are just adjectives that happen to be immediately dominated by AP or VP. ”
                            Nevertheless, there are some “intensive adverbs” which, even upon having the ad­
                            verbial suffix -ly removed, either cannot be used predicatively at all (65), or have a
                             different meaning than the -ly counterpart (66):
                             [Based on non-numbered examples in Bresnan, p.292]
                             (65) a.      Norma is utterly brilliant
                                    a.’   *Norma is utter.

                                  32 Bresnan also provides interesting data in which, even though ER has enclitidzed onto
                             much, freeing up the Deg slot, elements such as no or any have been generated in the Deg slot,
                             thus preventing AP Shift anyways.




                                                                            159

                                      Bresnan essentially treats this special category of Adv as standing in the
                             same relationship to an adjective or “regular” adverb as a determiner does to an NP
                             and as a degree does to a QP:

                             through the Det projection, as in (71) [= Bresnan’s #129] (as proposed by e.g.,
                             Selkirk (1970) and Bowers (1968)):

                                      Bresnan justifies her choice based on a process which she calls QP Shift
                             (p.248). QP Shift moves the higher quantifier and any degree modifier within QP
                             around a following NP as in the following examples:34
                             (73)     a.      I have as many too many marbles asyou.—> [Bresnan’s #132]

                                       b.     I have 6 marbles too many.
                                      Bresnan notes the following restrictions on QP Shift, the first of which I
                             have rephrased in order to emphasize what I see as the crucial characteristic of the
                                 34 She does not mention whether or not QP Shift should allow QP’s to move to the right of
                             an AP. I take up this issue below.

                             (iii’) adjectives modifying quantifiers

                                     The example that Bresnan gives of this category involves a comparison (79)
                             (p.251, no example number), although this is not necessary (80):
                             (79)    rather noticeably more
                             (80)    quite obviously too many
                                     What is necessary, although Bresnan does not mention this, is that there be
                             a Deg to modify, such as ER and too in (79) and (80), respectively, since it is Deg
                             that the adjective modifies, not really a Q. Such adjectives in adverb guise cannot
                             modify a bare Q:
                             (81)    *rather noticeably many / much
                             (82)    *quite obviously many / much
                                     In any case, Bresnan proposes the following phrase structure rules for the
                             expansion of AP’ and QP’, to capture the ability of both AP’s and QP’s to modify
                             either AP’s or QP’s, and to do so recursively [=Bresnan’s #146]:
                                  “ Jackendoff (1977) points out that this isn’t true. For example, (i) varies with (ii):
                                  (i) 5 loaves too much bread.
                                  (ii) 5 loaves of bread too much.
                                  If these are derived by QP Shift, then QP Shift allows non-count QP’s to be shifted, as long
                             as the preceding measure phrase is a count noun.

                             4.2.1.2 Jackendoff (1977)
                                     Jackendoff notes that some adjective phrases can subcategorize for measure
                             phrases, as Bresnan noticed. Similarly, he acknowledges that different and alike
                             may be preceded by an overt element such as much, little, and far (this last one in
                             the case of different only). Since these are essentially the only adjectives which
                             may cooccur with a preceding much, little, or far, and since only certain adjective
                             phrases may subcategorized for measure phrases, Jackendoff proposes that both of
                             these properties be marked in the lexicon as idiosyncratic properties of certain lexi­
                             cal items, and that the general phrase structure rule for adjectival degree modifica­
                             tion should not include a QP projection. This avoids the need for Bresnan’s Much
                             Deletion rule, and the idiosyncrasies involved with the adjectives mentioned above
                             need to be marked somewhere in the grammar anyways, so there is no extra cost in
                             ascribing these idiosyncrasies to the lexicon. Similarly, whereas Bresnan had no so­
                             lution for ruling out *little + Adj. for most cases of adjectives, Jackendoff’s deci­
                             sion to leave this to lexical subcategorization correctly predicts the facts at no addi­
                             tional cost, since the same adjectives that can appear with much are the ones which
                             can appear with little.
                                     A consequence of Jackendoff’s strategy is that more and less cannot be Q’s.
                             Recall that Bresnan proposed that although more and less are not Q’s themselves,
                             they contain many / much and little, respectively, which are Q’s. Jackendoff takes
                             more and less to be of category Deg, along with how, this, that, so, too, as. He
                            justifies the nature of this category partially based on the parallelism between some
                             proposed members of this category and the category Art (standing for article), eg.,

                                      An immediate problem that Jackendoff faces in nominal amount compar­
                             isons that was never an issue for Bresnan is how to rule out forms such as those in
                             (86), since unlike Bresnan, he takes more not to be formed from many or much, or
                             any other element in Q, but rather, base-generated independently. Hence, it should
                             be allowed to cooccur with any element base-generated in Q:
                             (86)     *more many, *more much, *more little, *more few, *more far
                                      However, Jackendoff’s solution of Idiosyncratic Spelling Rules (p. 147) is
                             not any more costly than Bresnan’s solution for ruling out forms such as *mucher,
                             *manyer, and *littlen3S

                                      more + far —>              farther
                                      Jackendoff’s system implies, as I mention above, that more is not the com-

                                   38 Dominique Sportiche points out (p.c.) that Jackendoff’s solutionis not any less costly than
                             Bresnan’s solution, either. Thus, the point at hand does not favor either solution overall, although
                             it allows for the feasibility of Jackendoff’s.




                                                                             165

                             parative of many or much but rather, a Deg alone with no Q ingredient. In a similar
                             fashion, less is a degree rather than being the comparative form of the Q little. This
                             causes another dilemma since now we have no way of ruling out the following un­
                             grammatical forms:
                             (88)     *less much, *less many, *less little, *less few, *less far [+ adj.]
                                      Jackendoff does not give a solution for this problem but rather leaves in
                             place an “unprincipled filter” (p. 149). He suggests that (the first four of) these un­
                             grammatical forms would be expected to have the following meanings:
                             (89)     *less much = more little > less
                                      *less many = more few > fewer
                                      *less little = more much > more
                                      *less few = more many > more
                                      Whereas Bresnan proposes Rules for Simple Comparatives to arrive at syn­
                             thetically-formed adjectival comparisons such as taller, Jackendoff apparently treats
                             such examples in a manner analogous to the spelling rules for arriving at more from
                             more plus many and other similar examples. He does not establish, however,
                             whether there would need to be an idiosyncratic spelling rule for every single adjec­
                             tive that takes the suffix -er instead of being preceded by the word more, or whether
                             one single rule would work.

                             enough
                                      Recall that Bresnan takes enough to be a Q, subcategorizing for a null Det.
                             This allowed her to avoid forms like the following:
                             (90)     *too enough, *as enough, *this enough, *so enough, *enougher
                                      Jackendoff takes enough to be a Deg instead. This explains its ability to
                             cooccur with other forms which Bresnan takes to be Q’s, shown in (91)-(93). As
                             for the word order, keep in mind Bresnan’s Enough Permutation, some form of
                             which any theory I am aware of needs:
                             (91)     far enough down the road
                             (92)     little enough pudding
                             (93)     few enough men



                                                                          166

                                      Recall that Bresnan could not generate these forms. Nevertheless, she was
                             able to rule out forms such as the following, which Jackendoff cannot:
                              (94)    *many enough men, *much enough pudding
                                      Jackendoff is forced to propose his own rule of deletion, by which many or
                             much gets deleted after enough.
                             (95)     Many-Much Deletion [his #6.34]
                                      enough — {many / much } —> 1 - 0
                                      OBLIGATORY
                                      Jackendoff points out that this is more restricted than Bresnan’s generalized
                             Much Deletion. Whereas Bresnan’s rule of Much Deletion applies across most ad­
                             jectives, Jackendoff’s rule of Much / Many Deletion is tied to a specific lexical item,
                             namely enough.
                                      In both Jackendoff’s and Bresnan’s proposals, more and enough function in
                             parallel manner. For Bresnan, they both either are or contain Q’s -enough is a Q,
                             whereas more contains the Q many / much. For Jackendoff, though, both more
                             and enough are Deg’s. Since more and enough can select for complements,
                             Jackendoff asserts that his account has the advantage of avoiding the claim that
                             Bresnan must make, that there are in fact some Q’s capable of governing a comple­
                             ment, a claim which is usually considered to be false. It is ordinarily assumed that
                             only Det’s or Deg’s can govern a complement.
                                      Another motivation for claiming enough to be a Deg is that it seems to act
                             like a Det in the nominal system, and in Jackendoff’s schema, Deg and Det are anal­
                             ogous positions. Jackendoff claims that enough can be a Deg or a Det This allows
                             us to consider the Enough Permutation rule proposed by Bresnan (which
                             Jackendoff calls Enough Shift) obligatory:
                             (96) [=Jackendoff’s #6.32]
                             Enough-5/n/f (revised):

                                                                           167

                                      When enough is a Deg (97), we do not see the results of the shift, since
                             there is a silent Q (deleted by Many/Much Deletion) that enough shifts around vacu­
                             ously. When enough is a Det (98), however, enough shifts around the noun and
                             we get forms such as pudding enough.

                             Recursion in degree phrases
                                      Jackendoff also disagrees with Bresnan as to the constituency of degree
                             phrase recursion. He agrees with Bowers (1968) and Selkirk (1970) that degree re­
                             cursion goes though Deg rather than through Q, since he wishes to provide a uni­
                             fied analysis of degree recursion in the nominal and adjectival systems, and he
                             claims that only nouns, and not adjectives, allow modification by QP.
                                      Thus, according to Jackendoff, the constituency of (99) is (100), schemati-

                                    As for the constituency in adjectival degree recursion, Jackendoff provides
                            the following tree (his #6.46), predicting the constituency in (105), which is analo­
                            gous to what he proposes for degree recursion in the nominal system (99):
                            (104)




                                                              Deg’              tall

                                    Bresnan would predict the following constituency instead:
                            (106) [[5 times / much / far ] [too tall]]
                                    In order for Jackendoff to maintain the constituency he claims for degree re­
                            cursion, he must invalidate evidence that Bresnan provides in favor of the con-

                             stituency that she proposes, namely her rule of QP Shift. Recall the data that Bres­
                             nan presents initially to demonstrative QP Shift [also = Jackendoff’s #6.47]:
                             (107) a.         I have as many too many marbles as you.—*
                                   b.         I have as many marbles too many as you.
                                   c.         I have six too many marbles.—*
                                   d.         I have six marbles too many.
                                     Jackendoff claims that there is not rule of QP Shift as proposed by Bresnan.
                             Instead, (107b) and ( 107d) are base-generated with PRO in the position occupied
                             by marbles in the (a) and (c) examples, respectively. The following tree
                             [Jackendoff’s #6.48] exemplifies the use of PRO in degree recursion:
                             (108)                                                      N ’”




                                                                                Q’              PRO


                                                                                many
                                                               too/as

                                                      marbles
                                     Jackendoff suggests that the measure phrase 6 marbles or as many marbles
                             is base-generated in a manner analogous to 6 marbles in the sentence ‘This tray is 6
                             marbles wide.”
                                     He notes that PRO need not be present in a structure such as (108).
                             Instead a noun countable by the type of measure phrase given but not identical with
                             the noun in the measure phrase may nevertheless appear
                             (108) a.         This book took five reams too many pages. [Jackendoff’s #6.49]

                                      This does not always work. Consider the following example given by S£ez
                             (1993) in (109a), translated from Spanish into English, with the intended meaning
                             shown in (109b):
                             (109) a.         *1 read 5 novels too many books.
                                   b.         As far as books are concerned, I read 5 novels too many.
                                      This may simply require a more careful formulation of what qualifies as a
                             measure phrase. Since the sentences in (108) are grammatical, we want to allow
                             the extended degree projection of a noun to be modified by a measure phrase con­
                             taining an underlying identical noun, as schematicized in (110), even though one of
                             the two instances of the identical noun must be null at S-str - (111) shows that it is
                             not grammatical for both instances to surface. Perhaps this condition is due to
                             some principle of economy.
                             (110) a.         This book took five too many pages.
                                   b.         This book took five pages too many.
                             (111) *This book took five pages too many pages.
                                      On the other hand, only a small class of nouns may occur within the mea­
                             sure phrase when that noun is not identical with the noun modified by the measure
                             phrase. This class of nouns includes container nouns such as ream, box, bottle,
                            package, and carton, as well as units of physically measurable properties, such as
                            pounds, grams, cubic centimeters, etc. It is odd that not just any noun may occur
                             in this case. In fact, this casts some doubt on Jackendoff’s use of PRO instead of a
                             rule of QP Shift, but it is not clear that there is sufficient evidence against his pro­
                             posal regarding PRO to discard it.37
                                      Bresnan also claims that QP Shift accounts for the impossibility of generat­
                             ing the following (b) sentences from the (a) sentences, assuming that of-insertion
                             bleeds QP Shift

                                  37 Saez (1994) actually presents some very fine arguments against Jackendoff’s proposed struc­
                             ture for similar examples in Spanish, but there are also problems with the structure he proposes in

                                    d.     *1 have half a dozen of these marbles too many.
                                     Jackendoff proposes that what really causes ungrammaticality in the (b) ex­
                            amples is a general prohibition on definite nouns in the position of second noun in
                            partitive constructions when used as the measurement of difference in a differential
                            degree construction. Thus, the (b) sentences in (113) [=Jackendoff’s #6.51] are al­
                            lowable, even though the second noun in the partitive is preceded by of, and even
                            “non-shifted” QP’s are ruled out in (114) [=Jackendoff’s #6.52] if the second noun
                            is a definite noun:
                                     a.      I have hundreds more marbles.
                                     b.      I have hundreds of marbles more.
                                     c.      I have 5 lbs. too much sugar.
                                     d.      I have 5 lbs. of sugar too much.
                                     a.       *5 of them too far
                                     b.       *half a dozen of those miles too long
                                     A final objection to Jackendoff’s schema, in favor of Bresnan’s QP Shift, is
                            that only count nouns may appear prior to a “shifted QP”, as shown by the impossi­
                            bility of a mass noun before a “shifted QP” in (115b) [Jackendoff’s #6.53], and
                            such a restriction can be built into a rule of QP Shift
                            (115) a.         much too much bread
                                  b.         *much bread too much
                                     Jackendoff claims, though, that one might just as well claim that his struc­
                            ture is correct and that there is simply a prohibition against non-count measure
                            phrases.




                                                                          172

                                      Both Jackendoff and Bresnan present compelling syntactic arguments in
                             favor of one or the other possible constituencies for degree recursion. Thus, there
                             is not enough evidence to decide in favor of one analysis of degree recursion over
                             the other.

                             4.2.1.3    Corver (1997)

                                       Corver takes the proposals made by Bresnan (1973) and Jackendoff (1977)
                             as his point of departure. He reframes each within more current X-bar assumptions
                             and makes a fundamental classiflcatory distinction between a SPLIT DEGREE SYS­
                             TEM   such as Bresnan’s vs. a UNIFORM DEGREE SYSTEM such as Jackendoff’s .
                                       Bresnan treats some degree elements as determiners, such as as, too, that,
                             how, so, and ER. Recall that in Bresnan’s degree system, not only degree expres­
                             sions, but QP’s, too, may also enter into both adjectival and nominal degree struc­
                             tures. These QP’s contain degree-related elements that are more quantifier-like than
                             determiner-like, such as much, little, and enough. Since there are two different
                             kinds of degree elements in this system, Corver refers to Bresnan’s proposal as a
                             Split Degree System Hypothesis.
                                       Jackendoff, on the other hand, claims that there is no QP in adjectival de­
                             gree structures. Hence, there is only type of degree-related element in the adjectival
                             system. His proposal lumps as, too, how, that, enough, and so together with
                             more and less, which for him are primitives rather than derived forms. Elements
                             such as many, much, and little only appear within the nominal degree system, in
                             which they are merely Q’s. Jackendoff’s proposal, according to Corver, is a
                             Uniform Degree System Hypothesis.
                                       Although Corver agrees with Jackendoff that Bresnan cannot explain the
                             ungrammaticality of the string Hittle + adjective, he agrees with Bresnan that “there
                             is an underlying QP within adjectival structures” (p. 123). Furthermore, he believes
                             in a split degree system, although not the same one that Bresnan proposes. In
                             Corver’s system, the quantifier-like degree words are more, less, enough, and “a
                             dummy quantifier much." As Corver notes, he does follow Jackendoff on one
                             point - he does not take more and less to be morphologically complex. Rather,
                             they are base-generated in Q. The following table summarizes the various claims




                                                                         174

                                     Note that Corver refers to “a dummy quantifier much.” He makes the inno­
                             vative claim that there are actually two instances of much, in the same way that there
                             are two instances of the verb do. Just as there is both a lexical verb do which be­
                             haves like any other main verb and a dummy verb do which serves to provide Do
                             Support in matrix questions (unless the subject is questioned) and negations, there
                             is a lexical quantifier much with semantic import and a dummy much. Dummy
                             much “occurs in an adjectival structure only as a last resort” (p. 123), just like
                             dummy do occurs in an inflectional structure only as a last resort I address his
                             claims about how each of the two types of much is used below.
                                     Corver refers to structures in which determinerlike elements are generated in
                             the specifier position of lexical projections, which is the type of structure tradition­
                             ally assumed, as conforming to the LEXICAL HEAD HYPOTHESIS. Both Bresnan
                             and Jackendoff use structures which adhere to this hypothesis.
                                     Corver, however, eschews the lexical head hypothesis in favor of the FUNC­
                            TIONAL HEAD HYPOTHESIS, as          proposed by Abney (1987) and Corver himself
                             (1991, 1994). From this perspective, determinerlike elements, and functional ele­
                             ments in general, take lexical phrasal (XP) complements.
                                     Corver justifies adopting the Functional Head Hypothesis based on two
                             types of evidence: (i) the interaction of ER Suffixation onto adjectives in synthetic
                             comparatives and c-command requirements, (ii) constituency as determined by left-
                             branch extractibility.




                                                                          175

                                      If we follow the Lexical Head Hypothesis, then the extended adjectival sys­
                             tem of a synthetically compared adjective would be more or less as in (116)
                             [=Corver’s #14]:
                             (116) [AP [FP -er] [A’ [A tall]]]38
                                      Unlike either Bresnan or Jackendoff, Corver explicitly claims, basing him­
                             self on Edmonds (1976), that the suffix-er in synthetic adjectival comparisons is an
                             allomorph of the word more of analytic adjectival comparisons. In the remainder of
                             his discussion of the structure in (116), he follows Jackendoff more closely than he
                             does Bresnan. He assumes that synthetic adjectival comparisons involve morpho­
                             logical combination of the suffix -er and the compared adjective. Recall that Bres­
                             nan proposes Rules for Simple Comparatives, by which the suffix -er which has
                             clitidzed onto the quantifier much is copied, not moved, onto the compared adjec­
                             tive, and then subsequently, much + ER is deleted.
                                       Corver assumes that in order for tall and the suffix -er to combine, one
                             must join the other via movement. If the structure in (116) were correct, then there
                             would be two possible movements capable of accomplishing the needed suffixa­
                             tion. Either the head -er could be lowered and right-adjoined to the head tall, or the
                             head tall could be raised and left-adjoined to the head -er. The first scenario goes
                             against the common assumption (eg., Kayne (1994)) that no overt movement
                             should ever be a lowering rule. Both scenarios would result in a structure in which
                             a moved element does not c-command its trace, a result which would “violate the
                             general ban against movement to a non c-commanding position” (Corver, p.124).
                                      However, if a structure conforming with the Functional Head Analysis is
                             considered (117) [=Corver’s #14], we see that the lexical head tall can incorporate


                                  M FP is an abstract notion utilized here by Corver to remain neutral between whether or not
                             the extended adjectival degree system includes a QP projection. Thus, FP could represent either a
                             DegP in the specifier of QP, itself in the specifier of AP, or merely a DegP in the specifier of AP.




                                                                             176

                             principles just mentioned:

                             constituency and left-branch extraction
                                     Corver also points to data involving restrictions on left-branch extraction.
                             Assuming that left-branch extraction is only allowed when the moved string is a
                             phrasal constituent, he attributes those cases in which left-branch extraction is not
                             allowed to involve either sub-phrasal elements, i.e., heads, or non-constituent
                             strings.
                                        Examples of failed left-branch extractions involving moving a head to a po­
                             sition meant for phrases only, namely specCP, are as follows [=Corver’s #16a and
                             c]:
                             (118) a.          *Howj is Peter [tj sane] ?
                                   b.          *Howj do you think he is [tj dependent on his sister] 740

                                        Corver assumes that Ross’s (1967) prohibition against left-branch extraction
                             is not generally valid. Thus, the ungrammaticality of the extractions in (118) can
                             only be explained if one adopts the Functional Head Analysis and accepts, along the
                             lines of Edmonds (1976) and Chomsky (1986), that substitution operations must
                             respect structure preservation requirements. That is, heads may only move to head
                             positions, and phrasal constituents may only move to phrasal positions. Under the
                             Lexical Head Hypothesis, by contrast, the extracted degrees in (118) should be
                             X P’s and hence, should be extractable.
                                        The fact that left-branch extraction is in fact permitted in the case of XP’s
                             can be seen from the following data [=Corver’s #17]:
                             (119) a.          [How badly]j was he [tj short of funds] ?

                                  39 Corver does not state anywhere in this immediate discussion what XP stands for, although
                             it can probably be inferred based on other structures given by him that XP is a hypothetical com­
                             plement of the adjectival head A°, should it have one.
                                  40 Corver cautions the reader to ignore the irrelevant reading in which how is a manner adver­

                                     According to the Functional Head Hypothesis, the extractions in (119) in­
                            volve XP’s. Thus, it is predicted that they can move to specCP, and the prediction
                            is borne out. The distinction between (118) and (119) with respect to left-branch
                            extraction follows from a functional head analysis but is left unexplained under a
                            lexical head analysis.
                                     Note that this result allows the use of left-branch extractibility as a test for
                            constituency in more complicated cases such as the following [=adapted from
                            Corver’s #18]:
                            (120) a.         (?) [How many IQ-points]j is John [tj less smart (than Bill)] ?
                                     b.      *[How many IQ-points less]j is John [tj smart (than Bill)] ?
                                     c.      [How many IQ-points less smart (than Bill)]j is John tj ?

                                     Corver points out that although the (a) example is not very elegant, it is
                            clearly much better than the (b) example, and the (c) example is the best of the
                            three. In the (a) and (c) examples, the extracted string is taken to be a constituent,
                            according to the above reasoning. That is, the extended adjectival projection should
                            conform to the Functional Head Hypothesis, as in (121) [=Corver’s #19b], rather
                            than to the Lexical Head Hypothesis, as in (122) [=Corver’s #19a]:
                            (121) [FP [how many IQ-points] [F’ less [AP smart ]]]
                            (122) [AP [FP how many IQ-points [F’ less ]] [A’ smart ]]
                                     In Corver’s terms, the split degree system proposed by Bresnan and the uni­
                            form degree system proposed by Jackendoff, in the case of adjectival degree modi­
                            fication, would be as follows under the Functional Head Hypothesis [Corver’s #12
                            and #13]:
                             (123) [DegP Deg [QP Q [AP A ]]]                            [split degree system]

                             PRONOMINALIZATION.          This is a large body of data in which much does appear
                             overtly in front of so, which Corver takes to be a pro-A(dj)P in the relevant cases,
                             even though much is not usually allowed to surface before an adjective. This is ac­
                             tually the only strong evidence that Corver presents in favor of postulating a QP
                             projection in the extended adjectival projection. All the other evidence that Corver
                             gives could be reframed in a uniform degree system as shown in (124).

                             So Pronominalization data
                                    Corver presents an interesting contrast between the degree elements as, too,
                             so, that, how, on the one hand, and more, less, and enough, on the other. This
                             contrast involves a phenomenon which Corver calls So Pronominalization, in
                             which an AP (or even the QP or DegP of the extended adjectival projection) is re­
                             placed by the pro-form so. Whereas the first set of elements require an intervening
                             dummy much when occurring with a pro-AP so (125) [=Corver’s #23 and #24,
                             combined], the second set occurs directly string-adjacent to so (126) [=modified
                             version of Corver’s #21]:
                             (125)     a.     John is fond of Mary. Maybe he is [too *(much) so].
                                      b.      John is fond of Mary. Maybe he is [as *(much) so as Bill].

                                                       indoors all day.
                                      d.      John told me he was afraid o f spiders, but I wonder [how *(much)
                                                       so he really is].
                                      e.      ?John is wild about Madonna, but I am not really [that *(much) so].

                             (126)     a.     John is fond of Mary. Bill seems [(much) less (*much) so].41
                                      b.      Of all the careless people, no one is [more (*much) so than Bill].

                                                      (*much) so to enter our graduate program].
                                      Corver explains the So Pronominalization data in terms of locality require-

                                 41 Carver’s original example did not have parentheses around the first instance of much. How­
                             ever, I have chosen to present it this way since this particular much is not necessary for the sen­
                             tence to be grammatical and since its presence or absence does affect the meaning of the sentence
                             but does not affect the line of reasoning of which this sentence is apart.
                                 42 I include this option as well since we would expect Q’s like much to permute around
                             enough, in a manner analogous to few and little in few enough and little enough, respectively.

                            ments on theta-binding relations. Corver assumes, along the lines of Higginbotham
                            (1985) and Williams (1981), that some predicates include in their theta-grid a refer­
                            ential argument that they need to assign. The XP acting as that argument needs to
                            be bound locally by the predicate in question. Hence, a verb seeks tense so that the
                            denotation of the verb is restricted referentially to those members of the verb’s de­
                            notation set occurring a given point in time. Similarly, a common noun seeks a de­
                            terminer which will restrict its reference to a subset of the noun’s denotation. In the
                            case at hand, degree-modified adjectives, such as compared adjectives, seek a de­
                            gree referential argument, in addition to an external theme argument43
                                     Corver assumes that in order for a predicate to bind a referential argument
                            the two must either be heads in adjacent projections or stand in a specifier-head rela­
                            tionship. Thus, Corver claims that in the ungrammatical variants in (125), i.e., in
                            the variants without much, the adjectival predicate represented by so is not, and
                            cannot get, close enough to the degree element to bind its referential degree argu­
                            ment (see below for the reason why). In (126), however, the adjective is close
                            enough to the degree element in order to bind its referential degree argument The
                            only way to explain why some degree elements are able to enter into a sufficiently
                            local relationship with an adjective, whereas others are not, is to adopt a Split
                            Degree System Hypothesis, as will become clearer below. This, as I commented
                            earlier, is exactly what Corver proposes.
                                     Corver considers those degree elements which may occur with so without
                            any intervening much to be base-generated in Q. This includes more, less, and
                            enough. Those degree elements which require a following dummy much before


                                 43 Corver assumes that a bare positive adjective, such as tall in (i), does not subcategorize for a
                            degree argument in its theta-grid, although he grants that one could claim the opposite, i.e., that
                            all gradable adjectives subcategorize for a degree argument
                                 (i) Juan is tall.
                                 Under this second, opposite claim, though, one would have to postulate some null degree ele­
                            ment, i.e., a null operator, which would stand roughly for the degree relatively very or more than
                            the norm.




                                                                              180

                             so are considered by Corver to be base-generated in Deg.
                                       Since those degree words which cannot directly precede so can precede it
                             with an intervening much, Corver, in an effort to provide a slot for much and in
                             order to lay the ground for a deeper explanation of the facts, concludes that all ex­
                             tended adjectival projections contain at least QP if not both QP and DegP.
                                       Any degree element generated in Q will always be close enough to the head
                             of AP or the pro-AP so to bind the referential degree argument of the adjective. A
                             degree element in Deg, however, is too far away to directly bind the referential de­
                             gree argument of the adjective it modifies, unless one of the two mechanisms dis­
                             cussed below takes place.
                                       If the A slot is occupied by a lexical head, then that adjective may raise via
                             head-to-head movement to Q, at which point, it and the degree in Deg are sufficient­
                             ly local to enter into a theta-binding relationship. Thus, if a Deg word modifies a
                             lexical adjective such as intelligent, then there is no need for an intervening much:
                             (127) too (*much) intelligent
                                       The adjective intelligent moves to Q to bind the Deg too as its referential de­
                             gree argument.
                                       If, on the other hand, the A slot is contained within the pro-AP element so,
                             which is the receptacle of the argument structure of its antecedent adjective, so can­
                             not move closer to Deg via head-to-head movement since it is not a head - it is a
                             pro-AP. Hence, according to Chomsky’s (1993) principle of LAST RESORT,
                             Hnglish   is allowed to resort to a language-specific tactic: MUCH SUPPORT. The ad­
                            jective-like element much is inserted in Q and inherits the adjectival argument struc­
                             ture carried in so. From its position in Q, much is able to bind the Deg as its refer­
                             ential degree argument since they are sufficiently close to one another.
                                       The strategy referred to as Much Support does not occur when not neces­
                             sary, i.e., when a lexical adjective, capable of raising to Q, occupies A. This fol-

                             which any unnecessary step should be avoided.

                             Recursion in degree expressions and measure phrases
                                      Corver’s Split Degree System correct predicts that the cooccurrence of a de­
                             gree element in both Deg and Q is limited to the one case where Q is Dummy much.
                             In any other case, such as in (128), the degree word in Q will bind the referential
                             argument of the adjective, leaving the degree word in Deg as an extra, unallowed
                             argument and additionally, as an operator with no property to bind:
                             (128)44 a.        * Cleofas is [DegP too [QP more [AP cunning]]].
                                     b.        * Poncho is [DegP as [QP less [AP mature ]]].
                                     c.        * [DegP How [ QP enough [ AP intelligent ]]] is Gonzalo ?
                                      Note that a uniform degree system, such as that proposed by Jackendoff,
                             would also rule these sentences out, since only one head can be base-generated in a
                             given head position, here Deg.
                                      Alternatively, one may adopt a split degree analysis in which more and less
                             are not primitives but are composed of much and little, respectively, plus ER, which
                             is what Bresnan (1973) and Rijkhoek (in progress) do. This, too, makes the cor­
                             rect prediction in (128a) and (128b), although (128c) requires an additional expla­
                             nation, since it contains neither much nor little. Recall that Bresnan simply stipu­
                             lates that enough subcategorizes for an empty Deg. An alternative solution for the
                             example in (128c), to which Rijkhoek, for example, might make recourse, would
                             be to invoke a semantic explanation, since enough is not a gradable property, and
                             hence, is not compatible with a degree modifier. In syntactic terms, we could say
                             that enough does not project a referential theta role, and hence, the Deghow quanti­
                             fies vacuously.
                                      The sentences in (128a) and (128b) cannot be ruled out on similar grounds


                                 44 I ignore the issue of where the second associate of these constructions (comparisons and an
                             enough, construction) would be generated, as does Corver in his article.




                                                                             182

                             if one takes more and less to be gradable predicates. Since there do exist differen­
                             tial comparative constructions (cf. §4.2.1.1 and §4.2.1.2), the concept of more and
                             less being gradable is quite reasonable. There is a syntactic obstacle to making such
                             a claim, however. Both Bresnan and Corver assume a structure for differential
                             comparative constructions that treats not more or less alone, but rather, more or
                             less plus the following adjective, as a gradable property (129):
                             (129) a.         Cleofas is [too much] [more cunning],
                                   b.         Poncho is [as much] [less mature].
                                     Recall that Bresnan, who follows a traditional lexical head analysis, claims
                             such structures in order to account for her rule of QP Shift in the case of nominal
                             amount comparisons ( 130)-( 131).
                             (130) a.     I have [as many] fftoo many! marbles] as you.—>
                                   b.     I have [as many] [marbles ftoo manvll as you.
                                   [adapted from Bresnan’s #132]

                             (131) a.      I have [6] fftoo manvl marbles].—>
                                   b.      I have [6] [marbles [too manvll.
                                    [adapted from Bresnan’s #133]
                                     Assuming the alternative constituency in (132) and (133), respectively,
                             should prohibit QP Shift from occurring, since QP Shift can only affect con­
                             stituents:
                             (132) I have [[[[as many] too 1 manvl marbles] as you.
                             (133) I have [[[[6] tool manvl marbles],
                                     Jackendoff, however, simply discards QP Shift as a rule altogether and ac­
                             counts for the sentences in (130b) and (131b) using PRO:
                             (134) I have as many marbles too many PRO as you.
                             (135) I have 6 marbles too many PRO.
                                     We saw earlier that this alternative approach is not without its own flaws,
                             but it is feasible enough to be considered as an alternative analysis to Bresnan’s .
                                     Secondly, if we adopt a functional head analysis, Bresnan’s proposed rule
                             of QP Shift moves Deg and Q independently of the NP complement of Q. This




                                                                          183

                             means that QP Shift moves non-constituents, an undesirable claim in any frame­
                             work which requires constituency for rule application.
                                     There is an additional argument against Bresnan’s proposed QP Shift A
                            variation in word order in an adjectival degree comparison, analogous to the varia­
                            tion seen above in nominal amount comparisons, is not possible, unless QP Shift
                            occurs after adjectives have already moved to Q. In that case, we would predict
                            string vacuous movement, as shown in (136c), (137c), (138c) and (139c), and
                            hence there would be no overt signs of its having taken place.

                                     In any case, QP Shift is not viable as such under current theoretical assump­
                            tions (eg., Kayne (1994)) according to which rightward movement is disallowed.
                            Since QP Shift is not an acceptable rule type under the current framework, it cannot
                            be used to make predictions about constituency.
                                     Recall, however, that Corver provides wh-extraction data involving differ­
                            ential degree constructions that supports the constituency shown in (140):
                             (140)    a.     (?) [How many IQ-points]j is John [tj less smart (than Bill)] ?
                                     b.    *[How many IQ-points less]j is John [tj smart (than Bill)] ?
                                     c.    [How many IQ-points less smart (than Bill)]j is John tj ?
                                     Corver’s extractibility test, then, does support the constituency suggested in
                             (129), repeated here for convenience:
                             (129)    a.     Cleofas is [too much] [more cunning].




                                                                         184

                                     b.       Poncho is [as much] [less mature].
                                     At this point, I present Corver’s specific proposals regarding the position of
                             differential measure phrases and measure phrases in general.
                                     Although he phrases the following in different terms, Corver assumes more
                             or less that a measure phrase like six feet in (140) is a complement to an adjective,
                             whereas a differential measure phrase like six feet in (141) is an adjunct modifying
                            a degree:
                            (140) Luisa is six feet tall.
                            (141) Luisa is six feet taller than Carmela.
                                     He argues that the presence ofsix feet in (140) alters the interpretation of the
                            adjective tall since without the measure phrase, the sentence would just mean that
                            Luis is relatively tall. The phrase six feet functions here in a manner analogous to
                            the way it functions in (142):
                            (142)    a.      Luisa’s height is six feet,
                                     b.      Luisa measures six feet.
                                     In (141), on the other hand, six feet does not radically alter the nature of the
                            sentence, since with or without it, the sentence conveys a difference in height be­
                            tween Luisa and Carmela. Although this distinction is not entirely clear to me, note
                            that six feet may occur in an optional by phrase in a variant of (141), in the same
                            same way as an agent may occur in an optional hy-phrase in a passive sentence
                            (143):
                            (141 ’) Luisa is taller than Carmela (by six feet).
                            (143) Luisa was kindly greeted (by Carmela).
                                     In any case, based on his distinction between measure phrases modifying
                            adjectives and differential measure phrases, Corver proposes the following struc­
                            tures for each [based on his #49 and #44, respectively]:
                             (144) Luisaj is [QP [sixfeet]j [Q’ Q [AP tj [A’ tall tj ].




                                                                           185

                             (145) Luisa is [QP [DegP six feet ] [Q’ e [AP taller]] than Carmela].45
                                      In both cases, the measure phrase surfaces in specQP, but in the non-differ­
                             ential case, the measure phrase originates as a complement to the adjective tall and
                             undergoes OBJECT SHIFT. As for the differential measure phrase, it originates as a
                             type of DegP directly in specQP.
                                      Corver claims a slightly different structure for those differential degree con­
                             structions in which the degree element in question is a determiner-like degree ele­
                             ment In this case, the differential measure phrase originates in specDegP, as in
                             (146) [=Corver’s #78]:
                             (146) a.         [DegP [DegP as much] [Deg’ too [QP e [AP tall]]]]
                                   b.         [DegP [DegP too much ] [Deg’ too [QP much [AP so ]]]]
                                      Finally, Corver considers adjectival degree modifiers such as extremely,
                             terribly, highly, etc., to originate in specQP, from which position it can bind an ad­
                             jective’s referential degree argument via spec-head agreement (147) [=Corver’s
                             #108a]. Recall that a degree element such as too is further away from AP and
                             hence, much must be inserted in Q (148):
                             (147) [QP extremely [Q’ [AP so ]]]
                             (148) [DegP too [QP *(much) [AP so ]]]
                             Note that Lexical much functions like the adjectival degree modifiers:
                             (149) Luisa is [QP [DegP much ][Q ’ e [AP taller]] than Carmela].
                             Different, alike, verbal adjectives
                                    Recall that Bresnan and Jackendoff address a small group of adjectives, eg.,
                             different and alike, which may be preceded by much:
                             [Bresnan, fn #4]
                             (150) a.      A tangerine isn’t as (much) different from an orange as I ’d thought,
                                    b.     You and I are as (much) alike as a horse and a cow.
                                  45 Corver appears to be assuming that morphology is a checking process rather than a concate­
                             nation process in this example, even though he assumed the opposite when attempting to prove
                             the superiority of the Functional Head Analysis. One would expect the following structure instead,
                             where -er is an allomorph of more, if he were assuming here that morphology is concatenation:
                                  (i) [QP six feet [Q’ -er [ AP tall ]] than Carmela]
                                  In any case, this discrepancy does not appear to affect his argumentation.




                                                                            186

                                      Corver assumes that the version with much has a different structure than the
                             version without much. The version with much, which is not Dummy much but in
                             fact Lexical much, has the same type of structure as mentioned at the end of the pre­
                             ceding section:
                             (151) A tangerine isn’t [QP [DegP as much ] [Q’ e [AP different from an
                                          orange]] as I thought].
                                      The fact that much can occur without a preceding degree element lends sup­
                             port to the claim that the much in (152) is lexical:
                             (152) A tangerine is much different from an orange.
                                      In the versions of (150) without much, the degree adverbial as is base-gen­
                             erated in Deg and different / alike, which is base-generated in A, simply moves to Q
                             to gain access to its degree argument in Deg.
                                      Corver also points out that certain adjectives of a verb-like nature, such as
                             afraid, and reliant, behave like different and alike with respect to their ability to be
                             modified by much (and little, too, for that matter).
                                     All in all, Corver’s work has tremendous value. It brings Bresnan’s and
                             Jackendoff’s earlier seminal works into terms compatible with more recent work
                             and offers a good theory to account for the earlier data and newer data. Neverthe­
                             less, it is not clear why a Q projection has to exist in the adjectival degree system,
                             other than to account for the appearance of much in So Pronominalization data,
                             which I grant does need to be addressed in any alternative proposal but which I do
                             not analyze any further here. The only elements that ever appear in Q rue Dummy
                             much, which even Corver claims has no semantic content, and a group of elements
                             which I believe actually belong in the same place as the other degree elements.
                                      In Do Support, do appears in a projection which is otherwise motivated se­
                             mantically. In Much Support, however, much resides in a position which arguably
                             does not have independent semantic motivation if one adopts the position on more
                             and less taken by Rijkhoek (in progress) below, in which they are not base-generat-

                                      The most important modification which Rijkhoek suggests with regard to
                             Corver’s work concerns the elements that Corver takes to be quantifier-like degree
                             words, i.e., more, less, enough, and Dummy much. In addressing more and less
                             specifically, she claims that they are the morphological combination of a quantifier
                             - many / much and little, respectively - which has raised to Deg - with the degree
                             element ER sitting there. She compares this to an adjective which has raised to the
                             degree head itself to form a synthetic comparative adjective.
                                      As for enough, she assumes that it is composed of a Deg plus a Q, without
                             claiming a specific morphological makeup. She does suggest that enough may dis­
                             tribute like cardinal numbers, and hence, should be a Q, but she treats this idea as
                             mere speculation.
                                      In Corver’s terms, Rijkhoek claims a Uniform Degree System, with the
                             only element originating in Q being the non-degree much. Although Corver does
                             not address the nominal comparative system, Rijkhoek does. She mentions SLQZ
                             data [quoted from a draft of this dissertation (cf. Chapter 3 and below)] in which
                             the SLQZ equivalents to mucker and manyer are manifested quite transparently,
                             lending support to the claim that more is actually morphologically complex. I ad­
                             dress this data below myself.

                                      Each of the proposals above has strengths and drawbacks. The following is
                             a summary of the characteristics of each:

                             4.2.2 The distribution of much and how it favors or disfavors each of
                                           the proposals
                             4.2.2.1 English
                                      We saw earlier that any theory claiming that degree-modified adjectives are
                             modified by QP’s faces the challenge of explaining the usual absence of much in
                             front of adjectives:
                             (153) a.         {how, too, so, as, this, that, too, very} + adj.
                                   b.         * {how, too, so, as, this, that, too, very} + much + adj.
                                              [unless adj. is replaced by so]
                                      In the nominal degree system, however, the same degree words must be
                             followed by much or many before the noun whose amount they modify:
                             (154) a.         {how, too, so, as, this, that, too, very} much / many + N
                                   b.         * {how, too, so, as, this, that, too, very} + N
                                     Recall the solutions proposed in §4.2.1. Bresnan proposes a rule of Much
                             Deletion before adjectives (and adverbs). This accounts for the above data but does
                             not really explain why things occur this way.
                                     Jackendoff assumes that adjectives may not be modified by a quantifier un­
                             less they are lexically marked as such, e.g. different and alike. Thus, the pattern
                             shown above is expected.
                                     Corver proposes a Q slot in between the Deg slot and adjectives. This Q
                             slot is base-generated empty when an adjective is modifed by a determinerlike de­
                             gree word such as those shown above46since adjectives czm raise into it and hence
                             theta-bind the referential degree argument of the degree in Deg. The word so is ex­
                             ceptional in this sense, but it is actually a pro-AP and hence, cannot undergo head
                             movement into Q. Therefore, as a Last Resort, Much Insertion takes place.
                                     What is unclear in Corver’s proposal is why many and much are usually
                             overt in nominal degree expressions. By analogy with the adjectival system, one
                             would expect a noun to be able to raise into Q in order to bind the referential degree

                                 48 I return below to Corver’s proposal regarding more, less, and enough.




                                                                            193

                             argument of the degree in Deg unless many and much are needed for some other
                             reason. Since many and much must in fact overtly intervene between a degree ex­
                             pression and a noun, I conclude that many and much in the nominal degree system
                             are of a different nature than the dummy much that Corver proposes for the adjecti­
                             val degree system.
                                     Corver does propose that there are two instances of much: a lexical much
                             and a dummy much. The latter appears only in cases of So Pronominalization. The
                             former occurs as a difference in degree in differential degree comparisons (i.e.,
                             much more tired, much too tired, etc.) and as an adverbial extent complement to
                             verbs (i.e., sings too much, studies this much, etc.). However, Corver does not
                             assign these two cases of lexical much positions analogous to the position held by
                             dummy much in the adjectival system and presumably held by lexical many and
                             much in the nominal system.
                                     There are adjectives which do appear after an overt copy of much: much
                             afraid, much alike, much different, etc. This instance of much is lexical, as it has
                             semantic import. I suggest, along the lines of Jackendoff, that these adjectives be
                             marked lexically as being able to be modified by a QP. In any case, Corver treats
                             these adjectives exceptionally - he allows these adjectives, as opposed to most oth­
                             ers, to be modified by lexical much in specQP, in a manner analogous to modifica­
                             tion of a degree element in Q or Deg by lexical much in the specifier of QP or DegP,
                             respectively.
                                     Other than in these exceptional cases, then, the Q slot in the adjectival sys­
                             tem is reserved for a dummy element, i.e., dummy much, or one of the elements
                             more, less, or enough.
                                     Let us assume with Rijkhoek for the moment that more is composed of
                             much / many plus ER, that less is composed of little plus ER, and that enough is
                             composed of a Deg plus a Q. Suppose that in each case, only the Deg component




                                                                          194

                            has semantic import in the adjectival degree system, whereas both components have
                            semantic import in the nominal degree system. It seems odd for a given projection
                            to consistently be semantically null in the adjectival system but consistently semanti­
                            cally meaningful in the nominal system.
                                     I do take many and much to have semantic import in the nominal system, as
                            I suggested in the first part of this chapter. They are adjective-like quantifiers that
                            contain MUCH, which represents abstract quantity or amount. Adapting Corver’s
                            terms, I assume that nouns not used as predicate nominals bind an amount or quan­
                            tity argument, not a referential degree argument, in a quantifier in QP. Some of
                            these Q’s are not gradable, for example, cardinal numbers such as three and existen­
                            tial quantifiers such as some or a few. 47 I take others, such as much and many, to
                            be adjective-like quantifiers (as suggested by Corver himself) which assign a refer­
                            ential degree theta-role to a degree in Deg. When no such degree is overtly present,
                            I will assume, contra Corver, that there is a covert degree element meaning roughly
                            ‘relatively’ or ‘more than the norm’. This is analogous to the case of bare gradable
                            adjectives, which are also interpreted with a degree of ‘relatively’ or ‘more than the
                            norm’.
                                     As for the adjectival system, Corver himself suggests that adjectives are ca­
                            pable themselves, just like much and many of the nominal degree system, of as­
                            signing a referential degree theta role to a degree element in Deg. Although the QP
                            projection that he suggests for the adjectival degree system provides a reasonable
                            explanation for the So Pronominalization data, I do not believe that it justifies the
                            presence of the QP projection for the majority of adjectival degree expressions.
                                     Perhaps so is not really a pro-AdjP. After all, so is also used to replace
                            other phrasal categories:
                            (155) I love to play the piano - so much so, that I hardly do anything else.
                                  [the second so represents at least the VP love to play the piano, and
                                          possibly die entire proposition I love to play the piano.]
                                 47 Note that this is not the case for few, which is gradable: very few, too few, etc.




                                                                             195

                                      Even if one assumes, nevertheless, that so is definitely a pro-AdjP in the so-
                             pronominalization data presented by Corver, perhaps so is lexically marked to sub­
                             categorize for QP, just like the words alike, different, afraid, etc., are and just like
                             adjectives such as tall, high, long, etc., are lexically marked to allow modification
                             by a measure phrase.

                             4.2.2.2 SLQZ
                                      SLQZ also exhibits asymmetries between the adjectival and nominal degree
                             systems. There are some degree words which can directly modify an adjective but
                             which modify a quantifier associated with a noun rather than directly modifying that
                             noun.
                             4.2.2.2.1 The Deg ta’ann
                                      The first example is a construction in which ta ’ann ‘so (much),48begins a
                             clause used as an explanation of the type ‘because of how (much...)’. It is option­
                             ally followed by zhye’b, which Pamela Munro (p.c.) calls an exclamatory particle
                             or adverb,which appears in exclamative-type sentences, both in the adjectival and
                             nominal systems. Following zhye’b if zhye’b is present, or directly following
                             ta ’ann if not, comes an adjective in the adjectival system or zye:einy or zi.'i’lly in the
                             nominal system:




                                  48 Munro, Lopez, et al (in preparation) define this word as ‘because’. It is true that in my data,
                             ta’ann occurs at the beginning of a sentence which serves as an explanation for another event or
                             state of affairs, thus exhibiting the type of function served by English because. Nevertheless, it is
                             likely that this word is a borrowing of the Spanish word tan(to) ‘so (much)’, a word which inter­
                             estingly enough can be used, among other things, in a way similar to SLQZ ta’ann:
                                  (i)         Dej6         mi      trabajo, tanto          lo      odiaba.

                             ceded directly by ta’ann. This is the opposite situation from that of adjectives,

                                  50 Sometimes SLQZ -ta' translates as something other than ‘too’, such as ‘very’, and some­
                             times the notion of ‘too’ is expressed in SLQZ viameans other than suffixation of ta’. However,
                             the generalization given in the text is adequate for the point being made.

                                     Furthermore, there is also a variant of the suffix -daa:a’n, namely -x:a %
                            which Rodrigo Garcia reports (p.c.) as being more characteristic of female speech.
                            Research thus far indicates that its distribution is similar if not identical to that of -
                            daa:a ’n. The following examples demonstrate that -xa: 't behaves just like -daa:a ’n

                            system, it must attach directly to an adjective ( 165a), never to zye:einy or zi:i ’lly
                            (165b), whereas in the nominal system, it must attach to zye:einy (166a) or zi:i’lly
                            (167a) but not directly to a nominal (166b) and (167b):

                                      A final example of SLQZ parallelism to the English pattern in (153)-(154),
                             i.e., where the adjectival system lacks a Q found in the nominal system, is that of
                             comparatives. This is taken up separately in §4.2.3.
                                      At this point, I discuss other cases of noun / adjective asymmetry in SLQZ
                             that do not parallel the English case in (153)-(154) so closely but that still hint at a
                             lack of quantifier projection in the adjectival system and the presence of one in the
                             nominal system. In §4.2.2.2.3-§4.2.2.2.7, we will see that an expression modify­
                             ing a nominal may contain dya’ or tya’, which, as I stated earlier, I take to be allo-
                             morphs of MUCH. In contrast, an analogous type of degree expression in the ad­
                             jectival system lacks dya’ / tya’ except in the case of exceptional adjectives like
                             zyuwa’ll ‘tall’ - this is not a problem since we already know that adjectives of the
                             type tall have been shown to behave exceptionally in English, and it is reasonable
                             that similar adjectives in other languages might behave exceptionally as well. We
                             will also see the word ba:all ‘how many’, which can only precede nominal expres­
                             sions.

                             4.2.2.2.3 Questioned degree
                                      First consider degree questions. When the degree of an adjective is ques­
                             tioned, the adjective is usually preceded by cata’lly (see examples below), which is
                             borrowed from Spanish que tal, literally ‘what such’. This Spanish expression has
                             various meanings. For example, it means ‘How are you ?’ if used in isolation but




                                                                          200

                             ‘How about if...’ when followed by si ‘if’ plus a proposition:
                             (168)        £Qu6 tal si nos vemos manana?
                                           what such if ref! see. 1pi tomorrow
                                         ‘How about if we see each other tomorrow ?’
                                        A similar Spanish expression, que tan, literally meaning ‘what so’, is used
                             in Spanish to question the degree of an adjective, often with a tone of incredulous­
                             ness:
                             (169) iQu6 tan importante es        la prueba?
                                    what so important be.3sg the.f test
                                   ‘How important is the test ?’
                                        The SLQZ expression cata’lly appears to behave more like Spanish que tan
                             than like que tal, since cata’lly is used to question the degree of an adjective:
                             (170) Cata’lly nsinni ’ey Jwaany ?
                                     how intelligent Juan
                                   ‘How intelligent is Juan ?’
                                        To question the degree of a measurable adjective, i.e., when an actual nu­
                             merical measure is possible and expected, then the interrogative xi ze’cydya’ ‘how
                             much’ is used:
                             (171)        Xi ze’cy-dya’ zyuu:a’ll Jwaany ?
                                        what thus-MUCH tall       Juan
                                        ‘How tall is Juan’
                                        This is the same interrogative used when questioning the amount of a mass
                             noun:51
                             (172)        Xi ze’cy-dya’  gyu’uhzh      b-te:e’ch-u’ ?
                                        what thus-MUCH sand          perf-drop-2sg
                                        ‘How much sand did you drop ?’
                             (173)       Xi ze’cy-dya’    nnyi’ihs gwe:e’eh Jwaany ?

                                        ‘How much water did Juan drink ?’
                                        This is not a problem, since we have to mark adjectives like zyuu:a’ll in the


                                    51 Note that there is no distinction here on the basis of physical form, i.e., solid, liquid, or
                             gas.

                                       As mentioned above, count nouns use the form ba:all ‘how many’ to ques­
                             tion the amount of a count noun:

                                       Interestingly enough, if no precise answer is required, such as in an incred­
                             ulous question about quantity, one may use cata’lly followed by zye:einy, so that
                             once again, zye:einy distributes like adjectives in degree expressions:

                                       Thus, cata’lly, which does not include any form of zye:einy or dya’ / tya’,
                             is used to question the degree of non-exceptional adjectives, whereas xi ze’cydya’,
                             which overtly contains an amount expression is used to question the amount of
                             mass nouns and the degree of exceptional adjectives, and ba:all is used to question
                             the amount of mass count nouns.
                                       Note that even count nouns admit modification by xi ze’cydya’ if the em­
                             phasis is on not the exact amount of individual entities, such as books, but rather, a
                             larger bulk quantity, such as the number of boxes in the case of books:

                                      Again, the use of xi ze’cydya’ refers more to a bulk quantity of books, such
                             as the number of boxes of books involved, rather than to an exact amount of indi­
                             vidual books, which is the case when ba:all is used.

                             4.2.2.2A Deictic degree
                                      Another type of degree expression showing an asymmetry between the
                             nominal and adjectival systems is the degree referred to by pointing - i.e., a deictic
                             degree. As seen in §4.1.2, nominal expressions are preceded by either
                             zngreentya’ or te’ihbyzagreeniya’,s2both meaning ‘this many’ (in case of count
                             nouns) or ‘this much’ (in case of mass nouns):

                             expression, and therefore, I treat it as a separate morpheme, even though Munro, Lopez, et al. (in
                             preparation) apparently do not. Further research may elucidate whether or not te’ihby truly is en­
                             tirely optional and why or why not this may be.
                                  53 The element te’ihby is probably optional in this sentence, but I did not get the opportunity
                             to verify this.

                                         True adjectives other than the exceptional ones of the zyuu:a’ll type may not
                             cooccur with za’crenntya’ or te’ihbyza’crenntya’. Instead, the element za’crem
                             ‘(like) this’ must be used without the adjective that is understood in any particular
                             case, accompanied by the emphatic suffix -pa ’, apparently meaning ‘exactly’. This
                             type of construction does not really express the degree of an adjective but rather,
                             constitutes a qualitative comparison of equality. Consider the following examples:
                             (1 8 4 )    Zacrenn-pa’ n-a:a              x:-cotoony Liieb.

                                         ‘Felipe’s shirt is just like that’
                             (1 8 5 )    Za’crenn-pa’      n-a:a    x:-ye:e’cw-a’.

                                         The sense in which Felipe’s shirt is just like some other shirt being pointed

                             or ugliness, etc. No specific adjectival quality may be referred to in the sentence.

                                      In order to liken one object to another using a specific adjectival quality, one
                             may resort to a comparison of equality, which I turn to next.

                             4.2.2.2.5 Comparisons of equality
                                     I mention comparisons of equality here since, although they are not the main
                             focus of this dissertation, they involve degree expressions relevant for the argumen­
                             tation of this chapter.
                                     In nominal comparisons of equality, either te’ihbyze’cydya’ or simply
                             ze’cydya’ appears before the noun whose quantity is being compared:

                                      ‘Rodrigo bought as many books as Felipe bought’

                                   ‘Juan drank as much wine as Josd drank’
                                     In adjectival comparisons of equality involving measurable adjectives,
                             te’ihby ze’cydya’ or ze’cydya’ appears but outside of a relative clause (a degree rel­
                             ative - 1 discuss this in Chapter 5) containing the adjective whose degree is being
                             compared, not directly modifying the adjective:
                             (188)    a. (Te’ihby)-ze’cy-dya’ nih zyuu:a’ll Lia Paamm, zyuu:a’U Gyeeihlly.

                                             ‘Mike is as tall as Pam’

                                            ‘That table is as wide as this table’
                                     These adjectives may also participate in a construction used with all other
                             adjectives, which may only participate in this second type of construction. In such
                             a construction, the element ze’cy ‘thus’, usually suffixed by the emphatic particle
                             -eg, appears outside of a relative clause containing the adjective whose degree is

                                       Note that in either type of adjectival construction - that is, with (te’ihby)
                              ze’cydya’ or ze’cy(eg) —the degree element appears outside of the relative clause
                              containing the adjectival property being compared, not adjacent to the adjective.
                              This may indicate that (te’ihby)ze’cydya’ and / or ze’cy{eg) are degree operators
                              over entire propositions rather than just over an adjective property in adjectival com­
                              parisons of equality. Nevertheless, the fact that only measurable adjectives and
                              nominals allow the variant containing -dya’ at least shows that the comparison of
                              equality data does not argue against the proposal that only the nominal system regu­
                              larly contains a quantifier slot


                                   54 SLQZ has a native word meaning ‘different’ —yre:einy. However, this word cannot be used
                              in comparisons of equality. Instead, the borrowed word difere’eenn must be used in such a con­
                              struction.

                                      Another type of degree similar to the degree found in comparisons of equali
                             ty is what I call anaphoric degree. This is a degree which is anaphoric on a degree
                             which is salient on the discourse context In English, this is usually manifested as
                             this, that, or so:

                                      The special class of adjectives like zyuuta’ll ‘tall’ that can be measured can
                             use ze’cydya’ or te’ihbyze’cdya’ just like nominals in this type of expression
                             (197a). However, they may also use a combination of of ze’cy plus an emphatic el
                             ement and the element -za’ meaning roughly ‘also’ (197b)-(197c), which is the
                             only option available to other adjectives (198)-(199):

                             4.2.2.2.7 Free relatives of quantity and degree
                                      Free relatives of quantity and degree provide a final case of asymmetry be­
                             tween the nominal and adjectival degree systems. First I consider free relatives in
                             argument positions, and then I turn to free relatives in adjunct position.
                                      There are three cases of free relatives in argument position that I have dis­
                             covered thus far. When the free relative involves quantity of a count noun, the in­
                             terrogative ba:all ‘how many’ is used together with -tyehx:, a suffix roughly equiv­
                             alent to English -ever.5S


                                   “ The following free relatives are further proof that SLQZ -tyehx: is roughly equivalent to
                             English -ever:

                                       I now turn to surface asymmetries between the adjectival and nominal de­
                             gree systems in Spanish. In contrast to English, the primary difference in these two
                             systems in Spanish resides mainly in the fact that in the nominal system, number
                             and gender agreement are manifested as suffixes on a given Deg, whereas they are
                             absent on that Deg in the adjectival system.

                                       This can be seen transparently in the case of the degree of excess (209) and
                             in certain types of degree expressions in subordinate clauses, such as in embedded
                             exclamatives (210):

                             Deg’s in the nominal system. The agreement morphemes attest to its presence.




                                                                           211

                             pies. I claim that this is because the abstract element MUCH is only found in the
                             nominal system, and the agreement markers that surface are associated with
                            MUCH.
                                     In the case of other degree words, we observe a secondary difference, in­
                            significant in terms of the morphological composition of the elements involved.
                            They undergo stem-reduction when modifying an adjective, on the one hand, but
                            remain intact and are suffixed with the appropriate gender and number agreement
                            markers when preceding a nominal, on the other, as is exemplfied below.

                            4.2.23.2 Muy - the Spanish Deg corresponding to English very
                                     As discussed in the first part of this chapter, I take mucho and muy to be al-
                            lomorphs, both meaning ‘very’.

                                      When quantity is questioned in Spanish, the interrogative form cuanto ‘how
                             (much)’ is used with gender and number agreement, showing that what is really
                             being asked is the degree of “many-ness” or “much-ness”:
                             (213) i      Cu£nt-[ ]-o-s  libros compraste ?

                                      ‘How many books did you buy ?’
                                      An alternative form, composed of que ‘what’ plus tanto ‘so’ plus gender
                             and number agreement, is available for approximate or incredulous quantity ques­
                             tions:
                             (214) i Qu6       tant-[ ]-o-s libros compraste ?

                                   ‘How many books did you buy ?’
                                   [often said in incredulous tone]
                                      Adjectival degree is questioned by que tan ‘what so’ by most of the consul­
                             tants surveyed (215a). One consultant from Spain had a clear preference for an al­
                             ternative form considered literary by most of the other consultants, cuan (215b),
                            which I take to be an allomorph of cuanto ‘how (much)’:
                             (215) a.        £Qu6 tan    guap-o es          tu    prim-o ?
                                             what so handsome-m be.3sg 2sg.poss cousin-m
                                             ‘How handsome is your cousin (m.) ?’
                                      b.     £Cu£n guap-o         es     tu       prim-o ?
                                              how handsome-m be.3sg 2sg.poss cousin-m
                                             ‘How handsome is your cousin (m.) ?’
                                      These two constructions are used primarily for non-measurable adjectives.
                            When the degree of a measurable adjective is questioned in an attempt to get a pre­
                            cise answer, a paraphrase involving quantity or verbal extent is preferred, especially
                            in technical contexts:
                            (216) a.         ^Qu6tan alt-o es           tu      prim-o?

                             4.2.2.3.5 Conclusions regarding MUCH in Spanish
                                      As I proposed in §4.1.2,1 maintain that MUCH is not manifested in
                             Spanish as mucho, but rather, some other abstract head whose presence is signalled
                             by number and gender agreement Recall that if the Spanish equivalent to English
                             much / many, which do not contain ‘very’, were mucho, which does, then we
                             would face the following difficulties:
                             (i)      English much / many may be preceded by a degree element. Spanish

                             (ii)     English very and much / many are lexically unrelated. Spanish muy appears
                                             to simply be a reduced form of mucho, as seen in the truncated

                                               ‘Yes, very.’
                                      It is better to take mucho and muy to be two allomorphs of the Deg ‘very’
                             and to consider there to be an abstract morpheme equivalent to English much /

                                             meaning ‘relatively’ or ‘more than the norm’.
                                      This is not an unreasonable claim, since the same has been claimed for ad­
                            jectives such as tall. Such adjectives are inherently only an indication of the dimen­
                             sion measured, and it is the degree expressions used with them that indicate how far
                             along the scale they measure in a given circumstance. When no overt Deg is pre­
                             sent, there is a covert Deg representing an understood / discourse-determined norm.
                                      This claim and the asymmetric behavior between the nominal and adjective
                             degree systems that we saw earlier show that the Spanish adjectival degree system
                             lacks a quantifier projection, just like the English and SLQZ adjectival degree sys­
                             tems do.61

                             4.2.3 ER and the comparative degree
                                      I assumed above that Rijkhoek’s proposal concerning more (and less, which
                             I discuss next) is correct Since I conclude, however, that there is not generally a Q
                             slot in front of adjectives, I must claim that there are two more’ s. A nominal more
                                 01 This generalization is true for most adjectives. Recall that measurable adjectives in English
                             and SLQZ allow quantification.




                                                                             215

                             includes MUCH and ER, whereas an adjectival more includes only ER.
                                     Although this account is somewhat undesirable, there are reasons why it
                             should nevertheless be adopted. Recall from Chapter 3 that some adjectives form
                             their comparative synthetically, simplying acquiring the suffix -er.
                             (223) taller, smarter, faster
                             Any proposal which assumes that more is always composed of both much and ER
                            must explain the absence of much in forms like (223).
                                     Bresnan accounts for the absence of much in (223) via her Rules for Simple
                             Comparatives, which copy -er from much-er onto the adjective and then delete
                            much-er.
                                     Jackendoff treats synthetically compared adjectives as a special case of ana­
                            lytically compared adjectives which are subject to Spelling Rules that convert
                             [more + adj.] into [adj.-er].
                                     Corver gives no account for synthetically compared adjectives.
                                     Rijkhoek claims that synthetically compared adjectives raise all the way to
                            ER in Deg, probably via Q, whereas analytically compared adjectives remain in A
                            while much in Q raises to ER in Deg. What she does not explain, however, is why
                            much is not present in the synthetically compared case.
                                     I claim the following. In nominal comparisons, there is an instance of
                            MUCH in Q, which raises to -er in Deg. The resulting form is replaced by more
                            via suppletion. This is in a way equivalent to what Jackendoff proposes, except
                            that he takes ER to be manifested as more and proposes Spelling Rules to convert
                            more + many / much into simply more.
                                     In the adjectival degree system, there is no Q (except in the special cases
                            discussed above). Certain phonologically light adjectives (possibly marked in the
                            lexicon as a special case) are capable of receiving the -er suffix in comparisons, and
                             thus move from A to Deg via head-movement Other adjectives cannot raise from A




                                                                         216

                             to Deg (either lexically-marked as such or too heavy phonologically). In that case,
                             -er is left stranded, but this is not acceptable since it is marked as a bound mor­
                             pheme. Hence, it is replaced by more, which serves as an allomorph for i t Again,
                             this is somewhat similar to what Jackendoff proposes, except that he proposes a
                             Spelling Rules to convert [more plus adjective] into [adjective + -er] in cases of
                             synthetic comparison.
                                     A possible objection to this claim62is that it is too much of a coincidence that
                             the independent allomorph of -er is identical to the combined form of MUCH and
                             ER. I provide cross-linguistic evidence below for my claim, but in addition, note
                             that one may simply resort to the insertion of a dummy much within Deg, different
                             from the one proposed by Corver in Q but equal in lack of semantic import, to form
                             more from -er. In fact, Rivara (1990) has suggested that much may simply indicate
                             positive orientation in certain cases, i.e., an orientation which measures from small
                             degrees to large degrees. Rivara’s suggestion is not incompatible with Corver’s
                             claim that dummy much has its own projection, but it does not require much to have
                             its own projection, either.

                             4.2.3.1 SLQZ evidence for two instances of more
                                     In SLQZ, ER is manifested as the suffix -ru’, as we saw in Chapter 3.
                             Thus, a nominal amount comparison involves the suffixation of -ru’ onto either
                             zye:einy ‘MUCH.sol/abs’ (111-94) and (111-95) or zid'lly ‘MUCH.liq/gas’ (111-96),
                             and -ru’ can never be suffixed directly onto a non-predicative nominal in SLQZ (HI-
                             88), (111-89), and (111-90). This is analogous to what I propose for the English
                             nominal system:
                             Count nouns

                                         It is not clear to me what the exact nature of maaz is, though. One might be
                             tempted to claim that it shows the presence of a quantifier in the adjective system,
                             analogous or identical to MUCH.
                                         However, recall from Chapter 3 that the nominal system allows for the same
                             alternation as the adjectival system between [predicate + -ru’~\ and [Maazru ’ + predi­
                             cate], where “predicate” refers to zye:einy or zin’lly in this case:

                                         If maaz were truly an extra Q, it would be an extra Q in both the adjectival
                             and nominal degree systems. Hence, there would still be an asymmetry between
                             the adjectival and nominal degree systems, only the latter allowing for zye:einy or
                             zi:i'lly.

                             ed above, MUCH is not contained in mucho per se but instead is signalled by the
                             presence of gender and number agreement on Deg’s, a group of elements which in­
                             cludes mucho.
                                     In Spanish adjectival comparisons, ER is manifested either as (i) an unseg-
                             mentable part of the few suppletive comparative adjectives that have survived into
                             Spanish from Latin, such as mejor ‘better’, peor ‘worse’, mayor ‘greater / older’,
                             and menor ‘younger / lesser’, or (ii) a type o f mas distinct from the instance of mas
                             discussed immediately above, i.e., distinct from the type which contains not only
                             ER but also MUCH and agreement.

                             sonable to claim that the same is true for similar elements in other languages such as
                             Spanish mas. The one used in nominal comparisons includes ER, MUCH, and
                             agreement, and the one used in adjectival comparisons is simply the degree ER by
                             itself but in an independent allomorph. The few synthetic comparisons that there
                             are in Spanish include a fossilized suffix manifestation of ER.

                            4.2.4 Little and less
                                     Recall that Bresnan and Rijkhoek had no account of the impossibility of the
                             sequence [little plus adj.]. Let us turn to Jackendoff and Corver, who both do.
                                     They both take less to be a primitive, which explains why adjectives may
                             follow less without necessarily being allowed to following little. Jackendoff claims
                             that the adjectival system has no quantifier position available, except in case of ex­
                             ceptional adjectives such as different and afraid which either are covert compara­
                             tives or have a verbal/participial nature. Thus it is no problem for him that most ad­
                            jectives cannot follow little.
                                     Corver claims that both the adjectival and nominal degree systems contain a
                             QR Ms claim that less is a primitive base-generated in Q does not necessarily ex­
                             plain why little cannot occur there, assuming he takes the adjectival QP to be the




                                                                          220

                             same as the nominal QP, since the nominal QP may contain little:
                             (226) I found little help that day.
                             Thus, the way in which Corver would have to account for the ungrammaticality of
                             *little+ adj. is not entirely satisfying.
                                     Even Jackendoff’s account is problematic if one assumes the account I have
                             given here for more in nominal comparisons. Recall that I propose a complex
                             structure for more in nominal comparisons, consisting of MUCH plus ER.
                             Jackendoff considers more to be a primitive, just like less. If we take more to have
                             the internal structure in nominal comparisons that was just suggested, then less
                             should, too. A logical structure for less would be as proposed by Bresnan and
                             Rijkhoek: little (orfew ) + ER.
                                     There still remains the problem, then, of how to rule out [little + adj.].
                             Recall that in §4.2.1.1,1 mentioned that one could take the inability of little to ap­
                             pear before adjectives to be English-specific - what superficially appears to be the
                             equivalent to English little is allowed in some languages such as Spanish (42) and
                             French (43), repeated here for convenience:
                             (42)    Juan es            poco      inteligente.
                                     Juan be.3sg NEG.very intelligent
                                     ‘Juan is not very intelligent’
                             (43)    Jean est        peu         intelligent.
                                     Jeanbe.3sg NEG.very intelligent
                                     ‘Jean is not very intelligent’
                                     As I stated earlier, however, the glosses I choose for poco and peu. show
                            that I do not take them to include the element MUCH but merely some negative ele­
                            ment NEG plus muy / mucho ‘very’ andtres ‘very’, respectively. English, on the
                            other hand, conflates not only these two morphemes in little (and few) but in addi­
                             tion, MUCH (and number agreement). Only nominals and exceptional adjectives
                             such as different subcategorize for a Q slot and hence can be preceded by little.
                                     In order to translate Spanish poco and French peu into English, one must

                                     In comparisons of amount, less and fewer consist of ER plus
                             [NEG.MUCH] plus number agreement In adjectival comparisons, less consists of
                            only NEG plus ER.63
                                     Similarly, Spanish menos consists of ER plus [NEG.MUCH] plus number
                            and gender agreement in amount comparisons, but only NEG plus ER in adjectival
                            comparisons.
                                     The SLQZ equivalent of less is du:u’zh ‘(a) few’ plus -ru’ in amount com­
                            parisons, whereas the equivalent to less in adjectival comparisons is wzhi:i:a164
                             ‘not very’ plus ER. Hence, du:u’zh is the equivalent to English little, containing
                            NEG and MUCH, as in (228), whereas wzhi:i:a’ is the equivalent to Spanish poco
                            and French peu, containing NEG and ‘very’, as in (229):

                                     Thus, I have presented an account of the distribution of English little and re-

                            neutral as to whether Spanish menos contains the element ‘very’ and as to whether the SLQZ ele­
                            ment du.u’zh contains ‘very’.
                                84 Munro, Lopez, et al. (in preparation) list the expression a wzhi:i:a’ with the meaning ‘less’.
                            Nevertheless, I distincdy recorded data with wzhi:i:a’ with the meaning ‘not very’ and wzhi:i:eru’
                            with the meaning ’less’. Perhaps this reflects an idiolectal difference between Felipe Lopez and
                            Rodrigo Garcia.

                             NEG and MUCH, as does less in amount comparisons. The word less in adjectival
                             comparisons also contains NEG but does not contain MUCH, just as the Spanish
                             word poco does not contain MUCH in the adjectival system and the SLQZ word
                             wzhi:i:a’ does not contain MUCH.

                             4.2.5 Conclusions for §4.2
                                     I have presented arguments as to why the adjectival degree system does not
                             usually contain a quantifier, whereas the nominal degree system does.
                             Accordingly, I propose that there are two instances of more in English, a different
                             one for adjectival and nominal comparisons. The former is a pure degree element
                             with two allomorphs: the bound suffix-er and the independent word more. As for
                             nominal comparisons, more is the combination of MUCH plus ER. This dichoto-
                             mous system enjoys cross-linguistic support, both transparently (SLQZ) and indi­
                             rectly (Spanish).
                                     In the process of establishing these claims about the nominal and adjectival
                             degree systems, I have also provided evidence that Spanish mucho is more akin to
                             English very than it is to English much or many. Rather, the presence of the ele­
                             ment MUCH found in English much and many is signalled in Spanish by gender
                             and number agreement
                                     SLQZ, on the other hand, often uses zyeeinny or zi-'lly where English uses
                             many or much (depending on whether a noun is count or mass [solid/abstract], on
                             one hand, or mass [liquid / gas], on the other). Nevertheless, English much and
                             many are more general across degree expressions than SLQZ zye:einy and zi.'i’lly
                             are, which sometimes vary with the suffix dya’ / tya’.
                                     Lastly, I take orientation reversers of the type suggested by Rivara (1990) to
                             manifest themselves in quite a variety of ways cross- and intra-linguistically, both
                             in lexicalized forms and via negative morphemes or syntactic negation. The almost




                                                                          223

                            entire lack of [little + adj.] in English is due to the fact that little contains MUCH (in
                            addition to NEG), which must occupy a Q slot that most adjectival constructions do
                            not have. By extension, there are two types of less in English: in the nominal sys­
                            tem it consists of NEG, ER, and MUCH, whereas in the adjectival system, it only
                            consists of NEG and ER. Spanish has two parallel types of menos, whereas SLQZ
                            uses dutu'zh plus -ru’ as the equivalent of English less with NEG, ER and MUCH,
                            whereas it uses wzhi:i:a ’ plus ER as the equivalent of English less with just NEG
                            and ER.

                             5.0 Goals
                                      In this chapter, I will examine the structure of the second associate in
                             Spanish and SLQZ1comparisons of inequality.
                                      Recall from Chapter 3 that the second associate in Spanish comparatives of
                             inequality may be introduced either by de or que. I will claim that both of the fol­
                             lowing two types of comparatives in which the comparative particle is de involve
                             the same type of linkage between ER and the second associate, namely preposition­
                             al complementation of a degree to ER:
                             second associate introduced by de

                                     ‘Estela maintains more friendships than Tomds loses’
                                     In contrast, I will claim that Spanish comparatives in which the comparative
                             particle is que do not share this structural feature:
                             second associate introduced bv que

                                     ‘Estela drinks more wine than beer’
                                      I will call those Spanish comparatives in which the comparative particle is
                             que, and in which the second associate can be paraphrased with a clause, BARE
                             CLAUSE COMPARATIVES.           The motivation for this label is that the second associate
                             in this type of comparative resembles a que clause with no preceding preposition or

                                      In this chapter, then, I will propose structures for the various types of sec­
                             ond associate mentioned above, other than the type exemplified in (5). Some pro­
                             posals (e.g., Napoli (1983) and Hankamer (1973)) have attributed differences in
                             the structure of various types of second associate to a contrast between coordination
                             vs. subordination.2 However, I accept a view along the lines of Rijkhoek (1996),3
                             according to which coordination and subordination constructions share the same
                             overally syntactic conjunction structure and merely represent the two extremes on a
                             scale of the degree of parallelism between two conjuncts, a parallelism (or relative
                             lack thereof) both in semantic properties and in syntactic structure conjunct-intemal-
                             ly. In §5.1,1 present evidence in favor of this claim.
                                      Since in §5.11 reject that notion that the key difference in structure between
                             certain types of second associate lies in a difference between coordination and sub­
                             ordination, I make (in §5.2) a proposal which can explain the difference in another
                             way. What I propose is that: (i) those second associates which are prepositional de­
                             gree complements to ER, as in the case of Spanish de comparatives, may contain ei­
                             ther a simple, unmodified degree or a degree modified by a special relative clause
                             called a degree relative, and (ii), those second associates introduced by que contain
                             no degree relative and are instances of adversative coordinations, a notion which I

                                  2 There are also claims according to which some second associates are clauses whereas other
                             are subclausal phrases, i.e., phrases smaller than IP s / propositions, such as D F s, PP’s, and VP’s .
                             I do not address this directly here.
                                  3 Rijkhoek mentions that this is also suggested by Munn (1987,1992).

                                     I will discuss the varying use of the comparative particles in SLQZ in §5.3.
                                      Even though Spanish and SLQZ employ more than one type of comparative
                             particle for comparisons of inequality, English only uses than for comparisons of
                             inequality. Nevertheless, it is beyond the scope of this dissertation to explain why
                             there exists more than one comparative particle in comparisons of inequality in
                             some languages whereas others have only one, and similarly, I do not attempt to ex­
                             plain why one particle is chosen over another in any given case.4 I instead refer the
                             interested reader to Price (1990), in the case of Spanish, for a discussion of the use
                             of de vs. que in Spanish comparatives, and in the case of SLQZ, I leave the issue
                             open for future research.



                                  41 do in some cases mention empirical observations regarding a subset of the distribution of
                             one particle or another, without justifying why another particle could or could not have been used
                             in the same instance.

                             5.1 Coordination vs. Subordination
                                       In the type of framework assumed by Hendriks (1995, mentioned in
                             Rijkhoek (1996)), the following are all taken to be types of conjunctions: (i) ele­
                             ments traditionally called coordinators, such as and, but, or, (ii) complementizers,
                             such as that, because, before, and after, and (iii) prepositions, such as in, at, on,
                             and for. Hendriks refers to the latter two types of elements in a general sense as
                             subordinators, as opposed to coordinators. According to this typology, the con­
                             junction of two clauses, a clause and a sub-clausal phrase, or two sub-clausal
                             phrases must be an instance of either coordination or subordination, which
                             Rijkhoek refers to more generally as conjunction.
                                       It is traditionally assumed that coordination structures and subordination
                             structures can be distinguished on the basis of the types of elements conjoined in
                             each case and the syntactic behavior of the conjunction structure with respect to cer­
                             tain movement and deletion operations. In this section, I discuss some such proper­
                             ties, as proposed in the literature (Ross (1967) and Hendriks (1995, cited in
                             Rijkhoek (1996))). However, I will present data, some taken from Rijkhoek
                             (1996), showing that these properties do not consistently distinguish between what
                             have traditionally been termed coordination and subordination structures, respec­
                             tively.
                                       There are, nevertheless, general trends in syntactic behavior that do appear
                             to depend on the degree of parallelism between two conjoined elements. I will
                             claim that constructions traditionally labelled respectively as coordination and sub­
                             ordination share the same overall syntactic conjunction structure and actually differ
                             only in the degree of parallelism of semantic properties of the two conjuncts and/or
                             the syntactic structure within the conjuncts. I will thereafter refer to traditional
                             cases of coordination and subordination, respectively, as instances of coordination-
                             type conjunction and subordination-type conjunction in recognition of both the tra-




                                                                          228

                             ditional terminology and the real differences present both semantically and syntacti­
                             cally on the conjunct-internal level.

                             5.1.1 The nature of the conjoined elements
                                     As indicated by Rijkhoek (1996), Hendriks (1995) claims that although co­
                             ordinated elements can be of any syntactic category, the coordinated elements in a
                             given instance must be of the same syntactic category. Rijkhoek provides the fol­
                             lowing counterexamples to this generalization [her #74]:
                             (10) It seemed somewhat more dingy and in need of paint than I remembered its
                             (11) John is a linguist and proud of it.
                             (12) We talked about Mr. Colson and that he had worked at the White House.6
                                     I must point out that (12) is essentially ungrammatical in my judgment, so it
                             is questionable as evidence of coordination of unlike elements. It might be uttered
                             marginally by some speakers as an elliptical version of the following:
                             (13)   We talked about Mr. Colson and the fact that he had worked at the White
                                        House.
                                     In this case, what is actually being conjoined are two DP’s, not a DP and a
                             CP. Thus, (12) cannot be taken as clear evidence against Hendriks’ generalization.
                                     Nevertheless, the fact that unlike elements can be conjoined by and in (10)
                             and (11) clearly demonstrates that Hendriks’ generalization is not entirely true.7
                                     Therefore, Rijkhoek’s challenge to Hendriks’ claim that two coordinated el­
                             ements must be of the same syntactic category is valid.
                                     Turning to conjunctions that are traditionally assumed to be subordinators,

                                  5 Rijkhoek credits this example to Simak (p35, year not given in Rijkhoek’s manuscript)
                                  “ Rijkhoek credits this example to Hendriks (1995, p.128).
                                  7 Rijkhoek does mention that cases such as (11) have been treated by some (e.g., Koster
                             (1993)) as cases of coordination of like elements, namely Predicate Phrases. It is true that the con­
                            joined phrases in (11) are both predicates, which is why there is sufficient semantic parallelism to
                             warrant conjunction by a traditionally-labelled coordinator such as and. However, semantic paral­
                            lelism does not necessarily imply syntactic identity; therefore, it cannot be definitively concluded
                             that predicate nominals and predicate adjectives are in fact instances of the same syntactic category,
                            PredP. In (10), too, we see sufficient semantic compatibility for coordination-type conjunction of
                             two similar but non-identical categories, a predicative AP and a predicative PP.




                                                                             229

                             we see a variety of behavior with respect to whether the elements that they conjoin
                             must be, can be, or must not be, of the same syntactic category. Some subordina-
                             tors must conjoin like categories. For example, the conjunction when must conjoin
                             two clauses:
                             (14)   Griselda left when Jaime arrived.
                                     Other subordinators may conjoin like categories but need not. The conjunc­
                             tion before, for example, may conjoin either two clauses, as in (15), or a clause and
                            a subclausal element, as in (16):
                            (15)    Griselda left before Jaime arrived.
                            (16)    Griselda left before the end of the movie.
                                     Finally, members of yet another group of subordinators cannot conjoin ele­
                            ments of the same syntactic category. For example, the conjunction af can only
                            conjoin a clause with a DP, as in (17):
                            (17)    Griselda slept at our house.
                                     Since traditionally-labelled coordinators do not always need to conjoin two
                            like elements, on the one hand, and since subordinators vary with respect to this
                            property, on the other, the similarity or difference of the syntactic category of two
                            elements that are conjoined does not reflect a definitive contrast between coordina­
                            tors and subordinators.




                                 “ Within the terminology presented here, prepositions are a type of conjunction, more specifi­
                            cally a subordinator in Hendriks’ (1995) terminology.




                                                                           230

                             5.1.2 Movement properties
                                     Here I show that contrary to previous claims, there is no clearcut distinction
                             between coordination-type constructions and subordination-type constructions with
                             respect to the ability of different strings contained within these constructions to un­
                             dergo A’-movement, i.e., movement to non-argument positions.
                                     Ross (1967) identifies a Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC) by which
                            extraction out of a coordinate structure is impossible except when an identical (or at
                            least coreferential) element is simultaneously extracted from a parallel position in
                            each conjunct. Such parallel exraction is called across-the-board (henceforth ATB)
                            extraction. According to Ross, ATB extraction, and only ATB extraction, is al­
                            lowed out of coordination structures.9 Furthermore, as pointed out by Hendriks
                             (1995, cited in Rijkhoek (1996)), an entire conjunct in a coordinate structure cannot
                             be moved.
                                     Subordinate elements, on the other hand, are not generally taken to be is­
                            lands per se, although some types of subordinate structures, such as adjuncts, are
                            in fact islands for extraction. For example, the temporal adverbial clause in brack­
                            ets in (18) is an island for extraction:
                             (18)   *Whoj did you fall asleep [while John was kissing tj] ?

                                     Leaving aside well-studied cases such as adjunct islands, wh-islands, com­
                            plex noun phrases, and sentential subjects, though, extraction out of a subordinate
                            structure is expected to be allowed.
                                     We will see below, however, that the picture is not really so clearcut. Some
                            coordinate structures are less opaque to extraction than expected, e.g., some allow
                            non-ATB extractions, and conversely, some coordinate structures disallow even
                            ATB extractions. Similarly, some subordinate structures appear, rather surprising­
                            ly, to allow ATB extractions or to disallow non-ATB extractions for no obvious rea­
                            sons.
                                 9 Across-the-board extractions are illustrated in §5.1.23.

                                     The types of A’-movement exemplified in the data below are wh-question
                            formation, topicalization, and clefting. Rather than exhaustively testing each of
                            these types of A’-movement, I have included only enough examples, in contexts
                            which lend themselves to clear judgments for each type of A’-movement, respec­
                            tively, to highlight the lack of any crisp distinction between coordination-like struc­
                            tures and subordination-like structures. Data involving relativization would be ex­
                            pected to provide similar results, although space does not permit inclusion of such
                            data here. Most of the data are from English and are assumed to extrapolate to
                            Spanish and SLQZ. Time limitations in research prevented comprehensive explo­
                            ration of the relevant data in Spanish and SLQZ. Before presenting the relevant
                            data, I note the following terminological issues.
                                     Following Rijkhoek (1996), I will use the term second associate in non-
                            comparative constructions to refer to (i) either a coordinator or a subordinator, i.e.,
                            the conjunction, taken together with (ii) the second conjunct, i.e., the string con­
                            nected to the first conjunct by means of the conjunction.
                                     Topicalization in the languages under study involves fronting material to
                            sentence-initial position in order to call attention to a known referent and present the
                            remainder of the sentence as new information pertaining to it:
                            (19)     [This bookjj you should read tj.

                                     Clefting is a mechanism for enabling certain types of constituents to be fo­
                            cussed. In English, it involves linking a focussed constituent to the expletive pro­
                            noun it across a copula, all of which is followed by a clause containing old informa­
                            tion with a gap corresponding to the focussed constituent:
                             (20)    It is [this bookjj that you should read tj.

                                     Wh-question formation, in the languages under study, is the extraction of a
                            constituent to clause-initial position to form a constituent question:
                             (21)    [Which book]} should I read tj ?




                                                                         232

                             5.1.2.1 A’-movement of the second associate
                                      Consider the following instance of a coordination-type construction:
                             (22)    John gave Ted a stereo, and Sue gave him a TV.
                                      The second associate is inert to A’-movement, presumably because such a
                             movement would entail affecting a coordinate-type structure in an nonparallel fash­
                             ion, thus violating the CSC. Hence, (23) and (24), which would hypothetically be
                             derived from (22) via topicalization and clefting, respectively, are ungrammatical:10
                             (23)    *[And Sue gave Ted a TV]j, John gave him a stereo tj.
                             (24)    *It was [and Sue gave Ted a TV] j that John gave him a stereo tj.

                                      In contrast, some instances of second associates traditionally considered to
                             be subordinate, such as clausal adjuncts, can undergo A’-movement. Thus, the
                             second associate in (25) can undergo either wh-question formation, topicalization,
                             or clefting, as seen in (26), (27), and (28), respectively:11
                             (25)     Ted thanked Sue because she gave him a present.
                             (26)    Whyj did Ted thank Sue tj ?
                             (27)    [Because Sue gave Ted a present[j, he thanked her tj.
                             (28)    It was [because Sue gave Ted a present]} that he thanked her tj.

                                      However, other instances of second associates traditionally considered to be
                             subordinate, such as clausal complements, cannot undergo A’-movement. Thus,
                             the second associate in (29) cannot undergo either topicalization or clefting, as seen
                             in (30) and (31), respectively:
                             (29)    Ted thinks that Lyle is a liar.
                             (30)    * [That Lyle is a liar]j, Ted thinks tj.
                             (31)    *It’s [that Lyle is a liar]j that Ted thinks tj.

                                      It is not immediately clear what principled reason could account for the un-
                                  10 The proper noun Ted and the pronoun him have been reversed to ensure that the unaccept­
                             ability of the sentence could not be due to conditions on antecedence.
                                  11 Where relevant, antecedents and elements anaphoric on them have been reversed in derived
                             sentences in order to avoid possible interference due to conditions on antecedence.




                                                                            233

                            grammaticality of the attempted A’-movement in (30) and (31), and yet the fact re­
                            mains that such A’-movement is prohibitied.
                                     We have seen, then, that although A’-movement of a second associate in a
                            coordination-type constructions is consistently disallowed, similar movement in a
                            subordination-type construction is also disallowed in certain cases. Therefore, the
                            availability or unavailability of A’-movement of a second associate cannot be taken
                            to be diagnostic of coordination-hood vs. subordination-hood. In fact, Hendriks
                            (1995, mentioned in a footnote in Rijkhoek (1996, p.25)) similarly concludes that
                            the availability of fronting a conjunction together with the clause introduced by it is
                            not a characteristic distinguishing coordination and subordination.

                            5.1.2.2 A’-movement of the second conjunct alone
                                     One might also attempt to distinguish between coordinate and subordinate
                            structures based on extractibility of the second conjunct alone.12
                                     We saw in §5.1.2.1 that A’-movement of the entire second associate is for­
                            bidden in the case of coordinate structures. Similarly, as predicted by Ross
                            (1967),13since A’-movement of the second conjunct alone would involve affecting
                            the coordinate structure in a non-parallel way, one would expect that this is also dis­
                            allowed. This prediction is in fact borne out, as shown in in the following set of
                            examples. The second conjunct in the source sentence (32) cannot undergo topical­
                            ization (33) or clefting (34):14
                            (32)    John gave Ted a stereo and Sue gave him a TV.
                            (33)    * [Sue gave Ted a T V]j , John gave him a stereo and tj.
                            (34)    *It was [Sue gave Ted a TV] j that John gave him a stereo and tj.


                                 ,z I do not investigate the extractibility of the first conjunct alone, since this would introduce
                            unnecessary complications. For example, in some cases it is not entirely obvious what consti­
                            tutes the first conjunct among the material to the left of the conjunction.
                                 13 This is also mentioned by Rijkhoek (1996) referring to Hendriks (1995).
                                 14 Again, antecedents and elements anaphoric on them have been switched where necessary.




                                                                              234

                                     We expect that a second conjunct, when found within a well-studied type of
                             subordination-type island such as an adjunct, should be unable to undergo A’-
                            movement. This is in fact the case, as seen in attempts to topicalize (36) or cleft
                             (37) the second conjunct in (35):
                             (35)   Sue gave Ted a TV because Lyle told a lie.
                            (36)    *[Lyle told a lie], Sue gave Ted a TV because tj.
                            (37)    *It was [Lyle told a lie]j that Sue gave Ted a TV because tj.

                                     There is no principled reason, however, why the second conjunct in a sub­
                            ordination-type structure should not be able to undergo A’-movement when well-
                            known island conditions, as mentioned earlier, do not play a role. Surprisingly
                            enough, though, second conjuncts not found in islands, such as those within a
                            complement clause (38), may not undergo A’-movement, as seen in (39) and (40):
                             (38)   We think that you are smart.
                             (39)   * [You are smart] j, we think that tj.15
                             (40)   *It is [you are smart]j that we think that tj.

                                     Whatever the explanation may be for the unavailability of A’-movement of
                            the second conjunct in cases such as (38), we can see that both coordination-type
                            constructions and subordination-type constructions disallow A’-movement of the
                            second conjunct Hence, availability or unavailability of such movement cannot
                            substantiate any difference between coordination-type constructions and subordina­
                            tion-type constructions.

                            5.1.2.3 Extraction from within one or both conjuncts: ATB movement vs.
                                          unilateral movement
                                     Until this point, we have explored A’-extractions of elements including at
                            least an entire conjunct. Now we will see that extractions from within one or both
                            conjuncts are equally unconclusive regarding any systematic syntactic differences
                               15 In (38)-(40), I take the complement clause to include the complementizer, which does not
                            move.




                                                                          235

                            between coordination and subordination structures.
                                     One might attempt to distinguish between coordination-type and subordina­
                            tion-type structures based on whether extraction from within the first and/or second
                            conjunct can or must be unilateral, on the one hand, and whether it can or must be
                            across-the-board (ATB), on the other.
                                     As mentioned earlier, one would expect, based on Ross’ (1967) Coordinate
                            Structure Constraint, that extractions are expected to be allowed in coordination-
                            type structures if they are applied ATB, but otherwise not As indicated by
                            Rijkhoek (1996), this is not entirely true - there are some cases in which unilateral
                            extraction out of a coordination structure is also possible, and there are also some
                            cases in which ATB extraction out of a coordination structure is not allowed.
                                     Conversely, one might expect that subordination structures only allow uni­
                            lateral extraction, that is, either from the matrix clause or the subordinate clause or
                            PP but not both simultaneously, with the additional restriction that adjunct clauses
                            and adjunct PP’s are simply always islands to extraction. It turns out that some ap­
                            parently ATB extractions do occur in subordinate structures, and some non-ATB
                            extractions are surprisingly disallowed.
                                     First, consider the following coordination-type construction:16
                            (41)    Bill said that John gave Ted a stereo and that Sue gave him a TV.
                                     It is not possible to extract unilaterally from either the first conjunct (42) or
                            the second conjunct (43):
                            (42)    *Whatj did Bill say that John gave Ted tj and that Sue gave him a TV ?
                            (43)    *Whatj did Bill say that John gave Ted a stereo and that Sue gave him tj ?


                                10 I have embedded the coordination structure within the matrix predicate said to ensure that
                            auxiliary inversion could not even potentially occur in either of the conjoined clauses during the
                            process of question-fonnation. Such inversion would add another variable, since extraction of an
                            auxiliary could also hypothetically be either unilateral or ATB. Furthermore, since neither Spanish
                            nor SLQZ obligatorily uses auxiliaries in question formation, any results gained involving the in­
                            cidence of aux-inversion in English would shed no light on the behavior of subordinate-type and
                            coordinate-type structures in Spanish and SLQZ.




                                                                           236

                                     However, Williams (1994, cited in Rijkhoek (1996)) points out that non-
                             ATB extraction is allowed when coordination is asymmetrical.17 Asymmetrical co­
                             ordination can be detected, for example, when the meaning of sentence is changed
                             by swapping coordinates, as in (44)-(45) [=Rijkhoek’s #77]:
                             (44)   John went to New York and bought a painting.
                             (45)   John bought a18painting and went to New York.
                                     In cases such as (44), unilateral extraction out of the first conjunct (45) or
                            second conjunct (46) is allowed:
                            (45) Wherej did John go tj and buy a painting ?
                            (46) Whatj did John go to New York and buy tj ?19

                                     Another similar case signalled by Rijkhoek (1996, her example #81, at­
                            tributed to Lakoff (1986)), is the sentence in (48), derived via unilateral extraction
                            out of the first conjunct in a sentence like the one in (47):
                            (47)    I can take four courses for credit and still remain sane.
                            (48)    [How many courses] j can you take tj for credit and still remain sane ?
                                     Finally, consider the sentence in (49):
                            (49)    Bill said that you should fix your car or you’ll have no way to get to school.
                                     This type of sentence can give rise, via unilateral extraction out of the first
                            conjunct, to echo questions such as those in (50) and (51), which, as opposed to
                            many other types of echo questions, do involve A’-movement (witness the word




                                 17 According to Rijkhoek (1996), though, Williams claims that it is only out of the second
                            conjunct that unilateral extraction is allowed in such cases.
                                 ’* In Rijkhoek’s example, she uses the instead of a, but I use a in order to be consistent with
                            the first sentence.
                                 ,s This second sentence is Rijkhoek’s example #79.

                                        As for the availability of ATB extraction out of coordination-type structures,
                             it is generally possible, as claimed earlier. This can be seen in the question in (52),
                             derived from a sentence such as the one in (53):
                             (52) Ted said that either John will punch Lyle or Sue will slap him.
                             (53) WhOj did Ted say that either John will punch tj or Sue will slap tj ?21

                                        The acceptability of ATB extraction declines as a function of the complexity
                             of the conjuncts. This can be seen in (55), derived from a sentence such as the one
                             in (54):
                             (54)   Bill said that either John will give Ted a stereo or Mary will buy him a
                                          record.
                             (55)   ?*Who did Bill say that either John will give a stereo or Mary will buy a
                                          record ?
                                        One could argue that such a decline in acceptability is due to extraneous fac­
                             tors such as processing difficulties. Nevertheless, the fact that a sentence like (56)
                            cannot yield a question such as (57) via ATB extraction shows definitively that not

                                 20 The use of the pronoun they and their in the following sentences is more natural than him
                            or the more politically correct him or her in colloquial English even though it is considered incor­
                            rect in formal E n g lis h . Compare the interrogative sentence in the text with the following declara­
                            tive sentence:
                                 (i) Bill said that John gave someonej a stereo but that (whoever^ it was,) Sue gave themj a
                            TV.
                                 If the person asking the question were to presuppose that the person being asked about is
                            specifically male or specifically female (such as if this were an echo question), the pronoun would
                            then be him or her, respectively, instead of them. From now on, I will continue to use they,
                            their, and them in such cases since that is the most natural choice of pronoun in colloquial English
                            for an unknown, animate referent, whether singular or plural.
                                 It was brought to my attention by Pamela Munro (p.c.) that the claims that I make in this
                            footnote are discussed in Lagunoff (1997), to which I refer the interested reader for more details.
                                 z' In colloquial English, whom may only occur directly following a preposition, such as when
                            a preposition is pied-piped with its object to form a question or a relative clause, which in and of
                            itself is unusual for colloquial English. Therefore, in this text sentence, or in any other sentence
                            whore the prescriptive form whom does not follow a preposition, who is used instead.

                            all coordination structures allow ATB extraction:
                            (56)      Bill said that you should fix your car or you’ll have no way to get to school.
                            (57)      *Whoj did Bill say tj should fix their car or tj will have no way to get to
                                            school ?
                                      We have seen thus far that not only do some coordination-type structures
                            allow unilateral extraction, but furthermore, some coordination-type structures dis­
                            allow ATB extraction.
                                      Now we will see that subordination-type constructions do not always allow
                            unilateral extractions, nor do they always disallow ATB extractions.
                                      It should be noted that I will assume that the first conjunct in a sentence with
                            an adverbial adjunct clause22is exactly that material which precedes the complemen­
                            tizer introducing the adjunct This first conjunct is usually referred to as the matrix
                            clause.
                                      It is of course expected that extraction out of the adjunct clause is disallowed
                            since it is well-known that adjunct clauses are islands. This can be seen in (59), de­
                            rived from a sentence such as the one in (58):
                            (58) John gave Mary a present because Ted gave Sue one.
                            (59) *WhOj did John give Mary a present tj because Ted gave tj one ?

                                      What is surprising is that extraction out of the matrix is sometimes some­
                            what marginal. Consider the following marginal question in (61) derived from a
                            sentence such as the one in (60):
                            (60) John gave Mary a new car because it was her birthday ?
                            (61) ??Whatj did John give Mary tj because it was her birthday ?

                                      One might be tempted to attribute the oddity of (61) to semantic considera­
                            tions, but this argue does not hold up in the face of the questions in (62) and (63)
                            which mean roughly the same thing as the question in (61):
                            (62) Wbatj did John give Mary tj on her birthday ?

                                22 In order to avoid unnecessary complications, I do not consider relative clauses here along
                            with adverbial adjunct clauses, even though relative clauses are often taken to be a type of adjunct.




                                                                            239

                                     Further proof that the problem with (61) is syntactic and not semantic is the
                             analogous contrast between (65), formed from (64), and the semantically similar
                             questions in (66) and (67):
                             (64) John lacks respect for Mary although she has many accomplishments.
                             (65) ?Whoj tj lacks respect for Mary although she has many accomplishments ?

                             (66) WhOj tj lacks respect for Mary despite her many accomplishments ?
                             (67) WhOj tj lacks respect for Mary in spite of her many accomplishments ?

                                     We see, then, that some subordination-type constructions, just like most co­
                             ordination-type constructions, disallow extraction out of either the first or second
                             conjunct.
                                     There are even cases of subordination-type constructions which seem to
                             allow ATB extraction. Consider (69) and (71), derived from sentences such as the
                             ones in (68) and (70), respectively:
                             (68) I filed this article without reading it.
                             (69) [Which articlejj did you file tj without reading tj ?

                             (70) John killed Ted after threatening him.
                             (71) ?Whoj did John kill tj after threatening tj ?

                                     Questions such as (69) and (71) are considered by some (e.g., Engdahl
                             (1983) and Taraldsen (1981)) to be cases of parasitic gapping, i.e., sentences in
                             which a second A’-gap is licensed only in the presence of a preceding one. It may
                             be that there is actually an A’-operator licensing the second gap in each of these
                             cases. However, as long as one assumes that such an A’-operator is not base-gen­
                             erated but rather is a trace of an ATB extraction, then parasitic gapping can still be
                             taken to be a case of ATB extraction.
                                     In any case, we have seen that contrary to a priori expectations: (i) not all
                             coordination-type constructions disallow unilateral extraction, (ii) not all coordina-

                             tions appear able to allow ATB extraction. Hence, there is no consistent difference
                             in extraction properties between coordination-type constructions and subordination-
                             type constructions. Any general trends that occur must be due to semantic factors
                             and/or syntactic properties of the material within conjuncts.

                                     We have seen that movement properties cannot consistently distinguish be­

                             structures. This is true regardless of whether it is a question of extracting the entire
                             second associate, the second conjunct, or a smaller constituent from within one or
                             both conjuncts.

                             5.1.3 Deletion phenomena

                                      We saw earlier that movement phenomena cannot distinguish between what
                             are traditionally considered to be coordination constructions on the one hand and
                             what are traditionally considered to be subordination constructions on the other.
                             One might alternatively attempt to distinguish coordination structures and subordi­
                             nation structures based on their behavior with respect to deletion phenomena, such
                             as gapping and stripping, since it is traditionally assumed that such deletions are al­
                             lowed if and only if the relevant structure involves coordination rather than subordi­
                             nation. I will show, however, that this traditionally assumption, too, is more of a
                             trend than an absolute distinction.

                             5.1.3.1 Gapping23
                                      Gapping is a phenomenon in which all but two subclausal constituents of a
                             second conjunct are null or deleted under identity of sense with corresponding ele­
                             ments in the first conjunct. When gapping affects clausal coordination, the verb of
                             the second conjunct cannot be one of the two constituents which surfaces:
                             (72) Tomtis boughtj apples, and Estela [e]j oranges.
                             (73) *Tomtis bought applesj, and Estela sold [e]j.

                                      Therefore, in order for clausal gapping to occur, the verb must be identical24
                             in each conjunct. Furthermore, the overall structure in the two conjuncts must be
                             parallel. Lastly, only two constituents in the second constituent conjunct may be
                             left behind. Thus, if more than two constituents in each conjunct differ from corre­
                             sponding constituents in the other conjunct, if the structures in the conjuncts are not
                             parallel, and/or if the verbs are not identical in each conjunct, then gapping may not
                             occur.
                                      The following sentences are a priori are candidates for gapping, since in

                                 231 use coindexing here to indicate not movement but rather identity of sense.
                                 24 Although the verb may different in person and number from one conjunct to the other, as
                             pointed out by Pamela Munro (p.c.), the verb may not differ in tense, aspect, or lexical content.

                            Nevertheless there are cases of conjoined clauses with apparently sufficient paral­
                            lelism for gapping but which disallow gapping. Even though conjunction struc­
                            tures with and and nor, as seen in (74) and (75), respectively, tend to allow gap­
                            ping, conjunction structures with but and or do not allow gapping, as seen in (76)
                            and (77), respectively:
                            (74) Alicia married Ricardo, and Arturo married Linda.—>
                                 Alicia married Ricardo, and Arturo Linda
                            (75) Alicia didn’t marry Ricardo, nor did Arturo marry Linda —>
                                 ?Alida didn’t marry Ricardo, nor did Arturo Linda
                                 ?Alicia didn’t marry Ricardo, nor Arturo, Linda

                            (76)    Alicia married Ricardo, but Arturo married Linda—>
                                    *Alicia married Ricardo, but Arturo Linda

                                    ?*Either Alicia married Ricardo, or Arturo Linda
                                     We see, then, that traditionally labelled clausal coordination structures do
                            not consistently allow gapping. Thus we can already see that it is not true that all
                            coordination structures, as traditionally classified, may undergo gapping. I now
                            turn to gapping in subordination structures.
                                     It is standardly claimed that gapping is disallowed in the second conjunct of
                            a subordination structure, even if there is some degree of parallelism, such as in the
                            following example:
                            (78)    Tom2s bought apples because Estela bought oranges.
                            (79)    *Tomds boughtj apples because Estela [e]j oranges.

                                     However, gapping is allowed although somewhat marginally in certain
                            types of subordination structures in English, as shown by Rijkhoek (1996), while
                            in Spanish, gapping in some subordinate structures is completely grammatical, as
                            we will see below.
                                     In the following adjunct clauses, there is sufficient parallelism to allow gap-

                                     It is a significant result that gapping is allowed in some traditionally labelled
                             subordination structures, here, involving clausal adjuncts, as long as the conjuncts

                                 25 There are also cases in which an English sentence undergoes gapping more easily than its
                             Spanish counterpart:
                                 (i) ??John put out his cigarette without Mary hers.
                                 (ii) Juan        apago        su    cigarro sin que Maria 1-a           suy-a.
                                       Juan put.out.pret3sg 3poss cigarette without that Maria the-f 3poss-f
                                 The sentence in (i) is taken from This example is based on Napoli’s (1983) example in (i):
                                 (iii) John’s putting out of his cigarette without Mary hers didn’t help at all.
                                       [=part of Napoli’s example #5c]
                                 Another example she gives but which is quite marginal in my judgment is the following:
                                 (iv) The villain ended up with the woman instead of the hero with her.
                                       [also = part of her example #5c]
                                 28 This example is taken from Rijkhoek (1996, #75c). She does not take it to be odd even
                             though I do, as shown by the stigmas. She also gives the following Dutch equivalent:
                                 (i) Jan koch zijn exemplaar van Dracula voor Marie het hare.          [=Rijkhoek’s #75d]




                                                                           244

                             are sufficiently parallel. This means that gapping is not exclusive to coordination
                             structures.
                                     Despite the fact that not all subordination structures allow gapping, some
                             do, and recall that some coordination structures disallow gapping. Therefore, we
                            see that gapping cannot be used as a diagnostic for differentiating syntactically be­
                             tween coordination and subordination structures if in fact such a syntactic distinc­
                            tion exists.

                            5.1.3.2 Stripping
                                     Stripping refers to a process in which all material is removed from a second
                            conjunct except (i) one constituent other than the verb and (ii) optionally, a special
                            tag adverb such as too, also, or a negative element such as not (MacCawley
                            (1988)). Stripping is typically assumed to be available only in what I call coordina­
                            tion-type structures, although I will show that this is not really the case.
                                     The following sentences exemplify stripping in coordination-type construc­
                            tions. The sentence in (85) is the source for the stripped sentence in (86), and the
                            sentence in (87) is the source for the stripped sentence in (88):27
                            (85)    Mary just bought a new house, and John just bought a new house, too.
                            (86)    Mary [just bought a new house]}, and John [e]j, too.

                            (87)    Mary is tired, but John is not tired.
                            (88)    Mary [is tired] j, but not John [e]j.

                                     Note the following requirements for clausal stripping to occur.28 The (lexi-



                                 27 As was the case with gapping, I use subscripts to indicate identity of sense rather than actu­
                            al movement
                                 28 In their definition of stripping, Hankamer and Sag (1976) refer only to stripping on the
                            clausal level. They define stripping (p.409) as “arule that deletes everything in a c lau se [empha­
                            sis mine] under identity with corresponding parts of a preceding clause, except for one constituent
                            (and sometimes a clause-initial adverb or negative)”. Therefore, some or all apparent cases of strip­
                            ping on the phrasal level may actually be instances of clausal stripping. Since this is the case, it
                            is not instructive to examine the behavior of potential cases of subclausal stripping.




                                                                            245

                             lel. Furthermore, only one constituent in the second conjunct, other than the special
                            elements such as negation or special tags such as too and also, as mentioned above,
                            may be left behind. Thus, if more than one constituent in each conjunct differs
                            from the corresponding constituents in the other conjunct, if the structures in the
                            conjuncts are not parallel, and/or if the verbs are not identical in each conjunct, then
                            stripping may not occur.
                                     In general, sentences containing the conjunctions and and but allow gap­
                            ping, as can be seen in the following source sentence / gapped sentence pairs:30
                            (89)    John saw Ted, and he saw Sue, too.—>
                                    John saw Ted, and Sue, too.
                            (90)    John saw Ted, but he didn’t see Sue.—»
                                    John saw Ted, but not Sue.
                                     Note that Spanish allows stripping, too, as can be seen in the following ex­
                            amples:31
                            (91)    Juan     vio       a Pedro, y        vio     a Susana tambidn.—>
                                    Juan see.pret.3sg p.a Pedro and see.pret.3sg p.a Susana also
                                    ‘Juan saw Pedro, and he saw Susana, too’
                                    Juan      vio       a Pedro, y a Susana tambien.

                                    ‘Juan saw Pedro, and Susana, too’




                                 28 As was the case for gapping, a stripped verb need not necessarily match its antecedent verb
                            in number and tense.
                                 30 These examples have been chosen carefuly so that the gapped sentences’ most probable
                            source sentences are the source sentences indicated, although other interpretations are possible.
                            The interested reader is directed to Kuno (1981) for issues regarding interpretation of gapped sen­
                            tences.
                                 31 SLQZ allows stripping, too, but due to time limitations it was not possible to include ex­
                            amples here.

                                      We see, then, that structures involving and and but in English or their equiv­
                             alents y and pero in Spanish do allow stripping.
                                     Structures involving nor only marginally if at all allow stripping:
                             (93)    John didn’t see Ted, nor did he see Sue.—>
                                     ??John didn’t see Ted, nor Sue.
                                     However, structures involving ni, the Spanish equivalent to nor, allow
                             stripping quite well:
                              (94)    Juan no        vio     a Pedro, ni         vio        a Susana tampoco.—>

                                     ‘Juan didn’t see Pedro, nor Susana, either’
                                     Turning now to the case of the English conjunction or and its Spanish
                             equivalent o, we see that constructions involving or or o do not allow stripping at
                             all.33 The following example shows that conjunction structures with English or
                             disallow stripping:



                                 32 The Spanish sentence here is not ambiguous, even though the English translation given is.
                            In the Spanish sentence, Susana must be interpreted as the subject of the verb in the stripped
                            clause, even though the E n g lish translation seems to imply that it could be the subject or the ob­
                            ject of the verb in the stripped clause.
                                 33 English constructions containing or do allow VP-deletion such as in (ii) as a means for ex­
                            pressing the meaning intended in sentences such as (i):
                                 (i) Either John saw Ted, or Sue saw him.-*
                                 (ii) Either John saw Ted, or Sue did.
                                 Constructions containing Spanish o do not allow VP-deletion since Spanish disallows VP-
                            deletion entirely.




                                                                            247

                                    *Either John saw Ted, or Sue.
                                     Likewise, Spanish sentences with o ‘or* disallow stripping, too, as in the
                             following example:
                             (96) O Juan      vio        a Pedro, o Susana    lo         vio.—>
                                  or Juan see.pret.3sg p.a Pedro or Susana 3sg.m.acc see.pret.3sg
                                  ‘Either Juan saw Pedro, or Susana saw him’
                             (97) *0 Juan     vio        a Pedro, o Susana
                                  or Juan see.pret.3sg p.a Pedro or Susana
                                  ‘Either Juan saw Pedro, or Sue’
                                     We see, then, that although many traditionally labelled clausal coordination
                             structures do allow gapping, not all of them do.
                                     What is important is that we have seen that not all cases of cases of coordi­
                             nation structures allow stripping, even though which are potentially candidates
                            based on parallelism requirements. The major case disallowing stripping is that of
                             coordination structures in which the conjunction is or or its Spanish equivalent o.
                            We see that one cannot generalize the availability of stripping to all coordination
                            structures.
                                     I turn now to stripping in subordination structures. It is standardly claimed
                            that stripping is disallowed in the second conjunct of a subordination structure.
                            This makes sense considering the requirement that the two conjuncts be parallel and
                             that fact that a subordinate element does not very often parallel the function or struc­
                             ture of the matrix clause. We will see, however, that stripping is in fact allowed in
                             certain structures traditionally considered to be cases of subordination.
                                     Consider first the sentences in (98)-(100), in which the adjunct clause very
                             closely parallels the matrix clause in both structure in meaning. Note that stripping
                             is barred regardless of this parallelism:
                             (98)   Maiy just bought a new house because John just bought a new house.—>
                                    *Mary [just bought a new house]j because John [e]j(, too).




                                                                         248

                                          since Elaine and Phil didn’t snatch it up.

                                      However, stripping is perfectly grammatical in certain types of adjunct
                             clauses, if one takes the following types of sentences, for example, to be derived
                             via stripping rather than simply involving base-generated of prepositional phrases.
                             (101) John left after Mary left->
                                   John left after Mary.

                                   John left before Mary.
                                      It is a significant result that stripping is allowed in some traditionally la­
                             belled subordination structures, here, involving clausal adjuncts, as long as the ev­
                             erything but the subject in each conjunct is identical and the subordinator chosen is
                             before or after.
                                      Note that stripping is also allowed in the equivalent Spanish sentences:
                             (103)     Juanse         fue antes que Marfa se            fuera.—»

                                      ‘Juan left before Marfa before’

                                      ‘Juan left after Maria’
                                 34 For the one speaker consulted, this sentence is impossible with que instead of de. It is un­
                             expected that despuds needs to be followed by de instead of que when stripping occurs, since one
                             would expect parallel behavior between antes and despues. This merits further attention.




                                                                             249

                                      Thus, despite the fact that not all subordination structures allow stripping,
                             some do, and recall that some coordination structures disallow stripping. There­
                             fore, we see that stripping cannot be used any more than gapping can as a diagnos­
                             tic for differentiating between coordination and subordination structures if in fact
                             such a distinction exists.

                             5.1.4 Coordination vs. subordination: review of results
                                     We have seen that traditional methods of distinguishing between coordina­
                             tion and subordination structures are not entirely consistent. First we saw that ele­
                             ments traditionally assumed to be coordinators can sometimes conjoin unlike items.
                             Then we saw that some subordinate structures disallow movement of the second as­
                             sociate or second conjunct just as much as coordinate structures do. Subsequently,
                             it was shown that (i) not all coordination structures allow ATB extraction from
                             within a conjunct, (ii) some coordination structures allow non-ATB extraction from
                             within a conjunct, (iii) some subordination structures disallow non-ATB extraction
                             from within a conjunct for reasons other than already well-known island condi­
                             tions, and (iv) some subordination structures allow ATB extraction. Lastly, we saw
                             that deletion processes such as gapping and stripping are not available in all coordi­
                             nation structures and are surprisingly available in certain subordination structures.
                             Therefore, I conclude that there is no overarching structural distinction between co­
                             ordination constructions and subordination constructions. Instead, there are differ­
                             ences in the the degree to which the conjuncts are parallel semantically and differ­
                             ences in their internal syntactic structure.




                                                                         250

                             5.2 The proposal: Spanish
                                      I have shown that there is no clear syntactic difference between coordination
                             and subordination. Thus, Spanish de and que comparatives cannot be distin­
                             guished in terms of subordination vs. coordination.
                                      Instead, I propose the following. The second associate in a Spanish de
                             comparative consists of a degree followed by a special type of relative clause, i.e.,
                             de comparatives involve a degree relative. In que comparatives, on the other hand,
                             the second associate involves a type of adversative conjunction structure to be dis­
                             cussed below.
                             5.2.1    Degree relatives
                                      Recall that at the beginning of this chapter, I suggested that Spanish de com­
                             paratives in which de is followed by the definite article lo with or without agreement
                             have essentially the same structure as those comparatives in which de is followed
                             either by a cardinal number or a measure phrase. That is, the type of comparison
                             with a cardinal number or measure phrase, as in (105) and (106), respectively, is
                             the model upon which comparative with degree relatives (107) are formed:
                             (105) Juan comid                 mds       de cinco hamburguesas.

                             (106)     Juan     corrib          mds               de diez kildmetros.

                                      ‘Juan ran more than ten kilometers’
                             (107)     Juan     comid           mds       hamburguesas de         1-o-s              que

                                      In 5.2.1.1,1 discuss the nature and structure of degree relatives in general.
                             Then in 5.2.1.2, based on this, I propose a structure for comparative degree rela­
                             tives.

                             5.2.1.1.1 The nature of degree relatives
                                      Recall from Chapter 3 that in general, the second associate of a comparison
                             in Spanish must be introduced by de plus the definite article with or without agree­
                             ment plus que if it contains an overt verb:35
                             (108) Jos6    compr6       mds             libros de lo que piensas.

                                   ‘Jos6 bought more books than you think’
                             (109)    *Josd comprd          mds            libros que piensas.
                                      Jos6 buy.pret.3g ER.MUCH.rn.pl       books that think.2sg
                                      ‘Josd bought more books than you think’
                                      Note that if the string lo que following de is missing, the sentence is un­
                             grammatical:
                             (110)    *Josd compr6          mds            libros de piensas.
                                      Jos6 buy.pret.3g ER.MUCH.rn.pl books of think.2sg
                                      ‘Josd bought more books than you think’
                                      In (108), the definite article lo shows no agreement. However, there are
                             also cases in which the second term of comparison in a comparison of quantity is
                             introduced by a string similar to de lo que but in which the definite article lo does
                             show number and gender agreement with the noun whose quantity is being com­
                             pared. This number and gender agreement signals the presence of the abstract
                             amount morpheme MUCH discussed in Chapter 4, presumably followed by a
                             covert copy of the norm complement to MUCH.

                                  “ The exceptions were mentioned in Chapter 3. I repeat them here for the reader’s conve­
                             nience. If the properties whose degrees are being compared in a partial comparison are the covert
                             degree or extent complement of (distinct) verbs, rather than the amount of a covert object noun,
                             then que may introduce the second term of comparison (Price (1990)), although Plann (1984) sug­
                             gests that this construction is not part of the core grammar:
                                  (i) Jos6 duerme           mds       que trabaja.
                                        Josd sleep.3sg ER.MUCH that work.3sg
                                        ‘Josd sleeps more than he works’
                                  The second exception is the so-called metalinguistic (Napoli (1983)) or epistemic (McCawley
                             (1988)) reading of a sentence like (i), meaning roughly (ii) or (iii):
                                  (ii) {What Josd is doing has more properties of sleeping than of working}
                                  (iii) {It is more the case that Josd is sleeping than it is the case that he is working}




                                                                            252

                                     This second construction occurs in comparative deletion, i.e., when the
                            verb in the second associate actually takes the noun whose quantity or amount is in
                            question itself as its own complement This is in contrast with the construction in
                            which lo does not show number and gender agreement is used preceding a verb ex­
                            hibiting null complement anaphora, such as piensas ‘you think’ above in (108),
                            which takes as its complement a larger proposition or entire clause containing that
                            noun.36 The following examples exemplify the de lo que construction in which lo

                            Ch. 3 for definition of second head of comparison), including the understood covert noun whose
                            quantity is being compared, is fronted to specCP in the process of relativization (cf. Kayne
                            (1994)). I have chosen to subscript the agreeing form of the definite article with the gap although
                            the agreeing form of the definite article signifies the presence of not only the covert quantifier but
                            also a subsequent covert nominal complement

                                     In (112) and (113), the second head of comparison is covert. In (111), the
                             quantifier MUCH second head is covert but its presence is directly signalled by
                             gender and number agreement on lo preceding its clause. Therefore, I take these
                             structures to be an instance of special relative clauses which have been termed de­
                             gree relatives by Gutierrez-Rexach (1995) for non-comparative cases and by Sdez
                             (1993) for comparative cases. Consequently, I turn the discussion momentarily to
                             the structure of relative clauses in general.

                                     I follow Kayne (1994) in choosing a raising analysis of relative clauses in
                             general. The raising analysis of relatives, originally proposed in a slightly different
                             form by Vergnaud (1974) and refined by Kayne (1994), claims that the common


                                 33 Here I use square brackets [] as a placeholder for the covert raised adjective.

                                                                              254

                             noun traditionally termed the head of the relative clause, i.e., the noun whose deno­
                             tation is restricted by a restrictive relative clause or simply modified by a non-re-
                             strictive relative clause, actually originates within the relative clause and raises to
                             specCP between D-str and S-str. In a degree relative, it is the syntactic manifesta­
                             tion of the gradable property whose degree is being relativized, i.e., the second
                             head, that must raise to specCP of the relative CP. Referential relative clauses are
                             preceded by a referential determiner, which determines the NP which has raised to
                             specCP. Likewise, degree relatives are preceded by a degree, which “determines”
                             the XP gradable property that has raised to specCP.
                                      In either case, movement of the antecedent of the relative within a single
                             clause, from its base-generated position to specCP, avoids the need to propose ei­
                             ther (i) that the determiner and the relative clause are base-generated as a discontinu­
                             ous constituent restricting an interspersed antecedent, or alternatively, (ii) that they
                             are base-generated as a continuous constituent but that the relative clause must un­
                             dergo rightward extraposition. Note also that in both referential relatives and de­
                             gree relatives, the determiner (referential or degree) preceding the antecedent of the
                             relative clause is base-generated outside of the relative clause.
                                      I now exemplify the structures just discussed. (114a) is a referential relative
                             clause, and it has the structure given in (114b):
                             (114) a.          Daniel es         el      nin-o que conociste   ayer.
                                               Daniel be.3sg the.m child-m that met.pret.2sg yesterday
                                               ‘Daniel is the child that you met yesterday’
                                      b.       Daniel es [pp el [^p [jsjp nino ]| que conociste tj ayer]]40

                                      Gutierrez-Rexach (1995) proposes a structure roughly of the type exempli­
                             fied in the following examples for non-comparative instances of degree relatives:41

                                  40 Later in this section, I address the issue of whether or not the NP nino originates within a
                             DP within the relative clause. I also address analogous issues for the other examples in this sec­
                             tion.
                                  41 Recall that the presence of MUCH is signalled by gender and number agreement when it has
                             a nominal complement, i.e., when it functions as a quantifier over a noun KIND.




                                                                             255

                                  42 This particular instance of MUCH is not signalled by gender and number agreement since it
                             either takes no n o m in a l complement at all or takes an abstract one.
                                  43 Gutierrez-Rexach considers the operator in specDP to be a “null operator on degrees”. I do
                             not analyze this in any depth but include it here since it is part of the structure that he gives. For
                             the interested reader, I include here the LF for (117) adapted from the LF that he proposes for an ex­

                                     These degree relatives are in accordance with Kayne’s (1994) Antisymmetry
                             framework since there is no rightward extraposition or adjunction.

                             5.2.1.2 Degree relatives in comparatives
                                     I now address the issue of degree relatives that are specifically part of a
                             comparative structure.44

                            5.2.1.2.1 Comparative deletion (CD)
                                     Plann (1984) considers those Spanish comparatives in which the compara­
                            tive particle is de to be clausal comparatives, except in those cases in which what
                            follows de is an amount or measure phrase, as in (105) and (106) at the beginning
                            of this section. For example, she gives (123) [her #2, gloss and translation mine]
                            as the source for (124) [her #3]:
                            (123) Daniel     puede      nadar      mds      de [g que Jesus
                                  Daniel be.able.3sg swim.inf ER.MUCH of          that Jesus
                                         puede nadar [q p lo ]]
                                         be.able.3sg the.n
                                  ‘Daniel can swim more than Jesus can swim’
                            (124) Daniel puede nadar mds de [s           [q P   lo ] que Jesus puede nadar          ]

                                     I agree that the second associate of the comparison does include a clause.


                                44 In the discussion, I simplify by ignoring the Deg that is associated with the second head
                            within the relative clause. Some might claim that there is none, but I claim that there is some un­
                            derstood Deg appropriate to the context of the sentence.




                                                                           258

                            However, I disagree that lo is base-generated inside of that clause,45nor do I take it
                            to be a Q. Instead, I take lo to be a Deg analogous to a Det in the nominal system
                            but taking a CP complement instead of an NP complement - in other words, this is
                            a degree relative, just like the non-comparative cases just discussed. In this particu­
                            lar sentence, the relative clause CP contains a covert measure phrase QP (symbol­
                            ized here as MUCH) acting as the extent of nadar ‘to swim’ but which has raised
                            between D-str and S-str to specCP. That is, I propose the structure in (125) for the
                            sentence in (124):
                            (125) Daniel puede nadar mds de [Qegp lo [q p [ q p M UCH que
                                         JesiSs puede nadar tj ]]

                                     Similarly, the other non-comparative degree relatives discussed above also
                            have comparative equivalents as follows with the structures indicated:

                                 451 explain below that one can assume that there is a covert Deg within the relative clause (in
                            the second associate) out of which the second head raises, but the overt Deg lo is base-generated
                            outside of that relative clause as the complement to the preposition de.

                             economy. There are non-comparative degree relatives of quantity in which the NP
                             complement of the relativized amount adjective MUCH is realized overtly:

                                      Note that although I am claiming that there is a determiner or degree base-
                             generated outside of relative clauses, this does not preclude the base-generation of
                             an additional covert determiner or degree within the relative clause. There is in fact
                             overt evidence for the presence of a determiner within one type relative clauses,
                             namely wh-relatives. Kayne proposes a slightly different structure for referential
                             relatives with an overt (wh-)relative pronoun than he does for relatives without an
                             overt relative pronoun. In (139), what raises to specCP is only an NP, whereas in
                             an example such as (140), the DP containing the common noun NP is pied-piped
                             along with it, and then the common noun NP subsequently raises to the specifier of
                             that DP:
                             (139) a.        the picture that Bill saw
                                   b.          the [q p [jqp picture ]j that [ Bill saw [jqp tj ]]]]

                                     Without entering into arguments as to whether or not our theory should
                             allow (139) and (140) to have different derivations, I note that if we do allow a
                             derivation as in (140) for referential relatives, structures analogous to (140) will be

                             tures that I have already proposed for them. In such a construction, the degree
                             phrase (with a null Deg head) containing the gradable property (the covert second
                             head in case of a comparative degree relative) would be pied-piped to specCP, and
                             then the property XP inside of the raised DegP would raise to the specifier of this
                             DegP. I illustrate this alternative type of structure for both non-comparative and

                             for future research and continue to assume the structures given in (129b)-(134b)47
                             for the sentences in (129a)-(134a) for the sake of exposition. This will not affect
                             anything significant in what I have to say.

                             5.2.1.2.2 Null complement anaphora (NCA)
                                       I now return to the comparison in (108), repeated here in slightly modified
                             form, exhibiting what I termed null complement anaphora (NCA) in Chapter 3.
                             (108) Josd    comprd       mds             libros de lo que piensas [e],

                                   ‘Josd bought more books than you think’
                             In this sentence, [e] stands for the understood complement of the verb piensas.
                                       I take the string lo que piensas to be a degree relative. The problem is in de­
                             ciding which property XP raises to specCP of the relative clause. If there were
                             number and gender agreement on lo, I would take that to be a sign, as I have be­
                             fore, of the presence of an abstract instance of MUCH and its NP complement, here
                             libros.
                                       In fact, there are some speakers who allow an agreeing form of lo instead of
                             unagreeing lo itself in this sentence:
                             (149) Jos6 compid             mds       libros de  l-[ )-o-s que

                                   ‘Josd bought more books than you think’
                                       One might assume that for these speakers, null complement anaphora verbs
                             like pensar ‘to think’ may take a null complement with equal syntactic complexity as
                             its anaphor—a surface anaphor in Hankamer and Sag’s (1976) terms. That is, one
                             might postulate the underlying structure of (149) for those who allow it to be as fol­
                             lows:



                                 47 Under either option, I consider there to be a covert Deg within the degree relative. I simply
                             chose to assume that it is not pied-piped with the second head when the second head does.




                                                                             264

                                     According to this point of view, the structure of comparative NCA for these
                             speakers would be the same as the one involved in comparative deletion, the only
                             difference being that more material is covert in NCA than in comparative deletion.
                                     However, Hankamer and Sag (1976) claim that the null complement of an
                             NCA verb is a deep anaphor; that is, it lacks any syntactic complexity in the under­
                             lying structure of the sentence. Their claim regarding NCA is based on non-com­
                             parative instances of NCA, although it is certainly plausible that it is correct for
                             comparative NCA as well. Therefore, I propose that the structure of (149) is as fol­
                             lows:

                             show gender and number agreement
                                     Under one approach consistent with Hankamer and Sag (1976), the appro­
                             priate interpretation of (108) would be (153a), with the structure in (153b), since
                             degree canno t be associated with a subpart of a syntactically simple null comple­
                             m ent In such a structure, lo would be a degree determining an abstract extent
                             quantifier which quantifies over the entire propositional complement of the NCA
                             verb, here piensas:




                                                                          265

                             (153) a.        {Jose bought more books than the extent to which you think that he
                                                     bought books}

                                      b.     Josd comprd mds libros de lo MUCHj que piensas tj [e].48

                                     However, the interpretation of (108) given in (153a) implies the properties
                             whose degrees are being compared are quantity (MUCH-ness) and extent (the ex­
                             tent of the proposition denoted by the null complement of piensas), which are in­
                             compatible.
                                     One might alternatively propose that the usage of lo indicates that in compar­
                             ative NCA, lo merely represents the direct object of the overt NCA verb.49 That is,
                             in a sentence such as (108), the appropriate interpretation would be as follows:
                             (154) {Jose bought more books than what (=that which) you think}
                             This would be analogous to the referential usage of lo in the following sentence:
                             (155) Tengo      miedode lo que         podrfa          pasar.
                                   have, lsg fear of the.n that be.able.cond.3sg50 happen.inf
                                   ‘I’m afraid of what could happen’
                                     I have two types of objections to this proposal. One involves the choice of
                             comparative particle, and the other involves selectional properties.

                             choice of comparative particle: que (e.g.. comparative ellipsis’) vs. de (e.g.. NCA)
                                     First of all, the string que lo que usually occurs instead of de lo que when
                             lo is used in a headless relative as a demonstrative, roughly equivalent to aquello




                                 48 Here, [e] represents the null complement of piensas.
                                 49 This was suggested to me by Dominique Sportiche (p.c.).
                                 50 The abbreviation ‘cond’ stands for the condition mood.




                                                                          266

                             equivalent to aquello with similar agreement meaning ‘that’ or ‘those’:

                                  5t Some speakers of Spanish appear to actually have the reverse interpretations of de lo que vs.
                             que lo que (with or without agreement). That is, for them, de lo que means more or less ‘than that
                             which’, and que lo que means ‘ than the amount/degree which’. For these speakers, only amount
                             is relevant in (i) —witness the presence of MUCH in the second associate - this is CD:
                                   (i) Juan         perdio          mas            libros que       l-[ ]-o-s  que le

                                        In (ii) identity of reference what is relevant —note lack of MUCH in the second associate
                             —this is a subset comparative, as described in Ch. 3.
                                        I have decided to limit my discussion to those varieties of Spanish in which the judg­
                             ments are as discussed above in order to present a coherent analysis for one system.

                                     If I restrict the discussion to those comparisons in which the comparative
                             particle is followed by lo, with or without agreement, the following generalization
                             holds:52
                             (161) Choice of comparative particle in lo que comparatives Spanish
                                   (a)    que, if lo determines reference, i.e., ‘that’ / ‘that one’ / ‘those’
                                   (b)    de,    if lo determines degree, i.e., ‘that much’ / ‘that many’
                                     This is roughly how Plann (1984) differentiates between the two types of
                             lo que comparatives, although her mle actually has broader scope than the rule in
                            (161). She includes que lo que comparisons as a subgroup of a larger group - what
                            she considers to be the non-clausal standards of comparison. That is, a sentence
                            like (160a), meaning (160b), is analogous to a sentence like (162), with no overt
                            indications of anything clausal following the DP estos libros at all:

                                     The clause after las in (160a) beginning with que is a referential relative
                            clause restricting the reference of the understood covert noun revistas following the
                            determiner las. Plann correctly considers this to be a non-clausal comparative in the
                            sense that the entire DP containing the relative clause is in fact followed by addition­
                            al clausal material, material which however is irrelevant to the degree of the com­
                            pared property. That is, that clausal material contains nothing parallel to that found
                            in the first term of comparison along the lines of the predicate ser interesante ‘to be
                            interesting’ The entire DP, even with the clausal material inside of it, merely consti­
                            tutes a DP contrast. In my terminology, (160a) is not an instance of comparative
                            deletion but rather, of comparative ellipsis.
                                     Plann does mention that what she calls non-clausal comparatives (instances
                            of what I term comparative ellipsis) may derive at some stage from clausal compara-
                                 52 This is not a comprehensive, theoretical explanation for why de occurs in some instances
                            and que in others covering all types of Spanish comparatives. Rather, it presents the distributional
                            facts for a subset of comparative types, namely those in which the comparative particle is immedi­
                            ately followed by lo (with or without agreement) and then que.




                                                                           269

                             tives, although she does not commit to this possibility. I believe that this is in fact
                             the case for most Spanish que comparatives and for all SLQZ cah comparatives. I
                             address this in more detail below.
                                     If lo is taken to be the direct object of piensas in lo que piensas, the compar­
                             ative particle should be que instead of de if the pattern in (161) is taken to be cor­
                             rect. The fact that the comparative particle is de disfavors the hypothesis that lo is
                             the direct object of piensas.

                             selectional considerations
                                     There is another factor which argues against this hypothesis. Recall the in­
                             terpretation of (108) under discussion:
                             (154) {Josd bought more books than what (=that which) you think}
                                     If lo is taken to be a DP direct object of piensas in lo que piensas ‘that which
                             you think’, then that which the hearer thinks is the content of a thought and not a
                             number of books. Similarly, that which the hearer thinks is not an individual who,
                            just like Josd, bought books. Therefore, it is difficult to see how that which the
                             hearer thinks could serve as a standard of comparison, explicit or implicit. That is,
                             it is not clear how one would arrive at a number of books (more precisely, a degree
                             of how many books) with which to compare the number that Jose bought if what /
                             that which is merely a referential direct object of think.
                                     One might also attempt similar type of interpretation in which lo que pien­
                             sas ‘that which you think’ is a DegP direct object of piensas:
                             (163) Jose bought more books than the number that you think.
                                     Here, we are comparing a number with another number, or more precisely,
                             one degree of how MUCH with another degree of how MUCH. However, even
                             though think is a transitive verb (164), it does not ordinarily subcategorize for a
                             DegP direct object (165):
                             (164) a.        Tthink lots of interesting thoughts.
                                   b.        Tthink “What am I doing here ?”
                                   c.        I think that you should leave.




                                                                          270

                             (165) #1 think three.53
                                     It is true that a sentence such as (165) would be fine as the answer to a
                             question such as (166), but this is an example of sluicing, i.e., there is a covert
                             clause here of which three is only a subpart (cf. its non-sluiced equivalent in (167)):

                             (166) How many people came to the party ?
                                   [can be answered by (166) or (168)]
                            (167) I think that three people came to the party.
                                     In fact, the literal Spanish translation of (165) is ungrammatical (168) - only
                            with the addition of the complementizer que can the elliptical sentence be uttered
                            (169):
                            (168) *Pienso tres.
                                  think, lsg three
                            (169)     #Pienso que tres.
                                     think, lsg that three
                                     Hence, it cannot be the case that Spanish de lo que NCA comparatives in­
                            volve a referential relative clause whose antecedent is simultaneously interpreted as
                            a DP or DegP direct object of the NCA verb.
                                     I claim instead of either of the two previous proposals that at LF, the null
                            complement of an NCA verb is replaced by a string containing the second head. In
                            the case of (108), the null complement is replaced by the string in (170):
                            (170) que compro x.MUCH.m.pl libros54
                                     Subsequently, the second head and its complement, i.e., MUCH (along
                            with agreement) and libros, raise to the specifier of the CP whose verb is piensas,

                                 531 use the symbol # to indicate that a sentence is elliptical and needs a context to be interpret­
                            ed as a complement proposition.
                                 54 The symbol x represents the covert Deg associated with the second associate instance of
                            MUCH and is determined by the context I usually omit it when giving the structure of compara­
                            tive sentences but include it here as part of the explanation of the copying mechanism of material
                            in the first assocate to the second associate (a slot for Deg must be copied from the first associate,
                            even theDeg’s are distinct between the two associates.)




                                                                             271

                             (108) would end up as in (171) at some point in LF:

                                     Note that once the trace tj is replaced by a variable x j later in LF, this struc­
                             ture is identical to the one I propose for (149), i.e., NCA in which lo shows agree­
                            ment (151).

                            5.2.1.2.3 Comparative subdeletion (CS)
                                     I extend the type of proposal I made in §5.2.1.2.2, in which I assigned
                             (108) the structure in (171) at some point in LF, to the type of CS in Spanish in­
                             volving the sequence de lo que without agreement and an in situ occurrence of the
                             second head of the comparison, the difference being that the analog to the null com­
                            plement of an NCA verb is mostly overt in CS - only MUCH and the understood
                            Deg associated with it are covert in CS.
                                     Recall from Chapter 3 that if the second head of a comparison is the abstract
                            amount expression MUCH, its presence is indicated not by number and gender
                            agreement, but instead by a partitive instance of de ‘of’ preceding the overt nominal
                            complement of MUCH (e.g., de oro, de agua, etc., not lo que encontro.. .de oro)

                                              ‘Tomds got more pens for himself than he requested pencils for us’
                                      Of course, since MUCH is covert, one might wonder whether it has raised
                             to the specifier of CP in its clause, stranding behind its nominal complement, rather
                             than remaining in situ (at least until LF). These two alternatives would be expected
                             to look the same on the surface, so an instance in which the second head is an ad­
                            jective is needed to decide this issue.
                                      If the head of the comparison is an adjective, the second head is overt and
                             remains in situ (173) rather than raising to specCP (174):
                             head of comparison is adjective
                             (173) Poncho es         mds guapo de lo             que es inteligente.

                             (174) *Poncho es mds          guapo de lo inteligente que es.
                                      Since I have concluded that the gradable adjective of a comparison in (174)
                             and the adjective-like quantifier MUCH behaves in an analogous fashion with re­
                             spect to degree modification, it follows that in the sentences in (172), MUCH must
                             remain in situ just as the adjective inteligente does in (173). This behavior is in fact
                             witnessed by the lack of number and gender agreement on lo in the sentences in
                             (172).
                                      There are three possible conclusions arising from the data in (172) and
                             (173). First, it is possible that comparative subdeletion structures are not truly de­
                             gree relatives. This would be an undesirable result, since a unified explanation of
                             intuitively related phenomena is always better than a disjoint explanation.




                                                                          273

                                     Secondly, it could be that the true head in Spanish comparative subdeletion
                             is not any of the gradable adjectives proposed above —i.e., prenominal MUCH and
                             adjectives such as inteligente. Instead, in subdeletion, there is a covert VP or
                             prepositional extent quantifier MUCH which is relativized.
                                     Under this second proposal, the previous cases of comparative subdeletion
                             would have the structures and interpretations indicated:55

                                 55 Note that whatever explanation underlies the sentences in the main text ought to extend to
                            the following sets of non-comparative sentences [I have omitted all potential instances of MUCH
                            from the glosses in order to present the glosses as neutral with regard to the presence and location
                            of MUCH]:
                                 (i) No me         puedo       creer      lo que Miguel       perdid     de dinero.

                                 (ii) N om e       puedo       creer      lo que Josefina       tom6       de leche.

                                 58 This covert element could just as well have already raised to specCP by Spellout. There is
                            no empirical way to tell whether or not it has already raised by Spellout
                                 57 This instance of MUCH, according to the proposal at hand, is the second head and acts as an
                            extent adverbial modifying either the verb encontrS or the proposition encontrd oro. This explana­
                            tion extends to the analogous instance of MUCH in the following examples in an analogous man­
                            ner
                                 58 Under this second proposal, this particular instance of MUCH, which is associated with the
                            oro, is not related to the second head MUCH. Recall that there is an understood Deg associated
                            with this MUCH determined by the context. This explanation extends to the analogous instance
                            of MUCH in the following examples in a similar fashion.

                                     Since this second proposal would introduce an incompatible comparison
                            (except when the first and second heads are verbal extent) - a comparison between
                            amount (172) or adjectival degree (173), on the one hand, and prepositional or ver­
                            bal extent, on the other, I discard it as incoherent.
                                     Lastly, it could be that Spanish CS does in fact involve degree relatives but
                            that the gradable degree simply does not raise to specCP until LF, perhaps because
                            the overt partitive de plus nominal is too heavy to raise in the overt syntax. The
                            structures at Spellout of the sentences in (172) and (173) would be as in (177) and
                            (178), respectively:



                                 58 This position is for verbal extent MUCH, not a QP slot in the adjectival system of in-
                            teligent, even though the interpretation given below it gives that impression. The problem is an
                            artifact of the ambiguity of the English sentence given as the interpretation.




                                                                          275

                                     I claim this third proposal to be the correct one, since it allows a coherent in­
                             terpretation and a consistency of structure among related constructions.

                             5.2.1.2.4 A note on archaic cuanto
                                     We saw in Chapter 3 that there is an apparently archaic variation of the se­
                             quence de lo que in which lo que is replaced by cuanto, which otherwise is used as
                             an interrogative (181), an exclamative (182) or a headless relative (183):

                             lo que, as shown in the following table:

                                      Recall that I concluded that when there is not agreement on lo in an instance
                             of NCA, there is LF copying from the first associate to the second associate of the
                             second head and the clause containing it. A sentence with NCA using cuanto with­
                             out agreement has the same type of interpretation. The sentence in (184), for exam­
                             ple, has the structure in (185) after copying into the null complement from the first
                             associate and raising the second head:60
                             NCA. no agreement

                             5.2.1.3 Unification of degree relatives with amount and measure phrase standards
                                           of comparison
                                     Recall that I claimed at the beginning of this section that degree relatives
                             have a structure based on amount and measure phrase standards of comparison.
                             Plann (1984) mentions the function of de in introducing a cardinal number or a
                             measure phrase, as in (15) and (16), as an additional, non-clausal usage of compar­
                             ative de:
                             (190) Jos6 comprd             mds          [de tres] libros.
                                   Jos6 buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.rn.pl of three books
                                   ‘Jose bought more than three books’
                                   [cardinal number, amount of N denotation]
                             (191) Elisa corrid              mds       [dediez millas],
                                   Elisa run.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl of ten miles
                                   ‘Elisa ran more than ten miles’
                                   [measure phrase, extent of VP denotation]
                                     Whereas Plann classifies examples such as (190) and (191) as an extra case
                            requiring de, in addition to what she considers to be clausal comparatives, I suggest
                            instead that these are actually two subcases of a larger comparative construction.
                            Namely, de is used to introduce elements denoting quantities or degrees - i.e., com­
                            plements of ER - some of which are self-contained (measure phrases or cardinal
                            numbers) while others are introduced by an abstract degree or quantity marker (lo
                            or agreeing form) and defined via a subsequent relative clause as discussed above.
                            Thus, we are able to unite Plann’s comparatives having clausal second terms and
                            comparatives with cardinal quantifiers and measure phrases.

                            complementation of ER
                                     This conclusion is consistent with the notion that one way in which the

                             comparative Deg ER may take a complement is via a prepositional phrase serving
                             as a standard for comparison, i.e., a starting point from which to measure upwards
                             in making a comparison, in a manner analogous to an adjective or verb taking a
                             prepositional complement filling a source theta role:
                             (192) a.          Pedro estd cansad-o de est-a clase.
                                               Pedro be.3sg tired-m of this-f class
                                               ‘Pedro is tired of this class’
                                      b.       Pedro     sali6        de 1-a casa.
                                               Pedro go.out.pret.3sg of the-f house
                                               ‘Pedro went out of the house’
                                      Similarly, a complex preposition such as lejos de ‘far from’ is composed of
                             an adverb plus a preposition, the latter of which introduces the same type of source
                             complement as for an adjective or a verb (cf. (192)):
                             (193) Pedro estd lejos de aqui.
                                   Pedro be.3sg far of here
                                     The starting point for the comparison may be simply a cardinal number or
                             measure phrase, as in (190)-(191), or it may be defined compositionally by a quan­
                             tity or degree relative, as we saw in non-comparative cases such as those analyzed
                             by Gutidrrez-Rexach (1995) (cf. (115)-(118)).
                                      Returning to some of our earlier examples of comparative deletion in
                             Spanish introduced by the string de lo que, repeated here, we thus obtain the fol­

                            tive degree relatives.

                             5.2.2 Bare clause comparatives

                             5.2.2.1 A unified analysis or a split analysis ?
                                     Recall from Chapter 3 that comparative ellipsis is preferred to comparative
                             deletion or comparative subdeletion if possible. In Spanish specifically, this
                             amounts to a preference for comparatives with que as the comparative particle (i.e.,
                             que comparatives) over comparatives with de as the comparative particle, followed
                             by lo que, i.e., degree relative comparatives, whenever possible. It was concluded
                             in §5.2.1 that the latter type of comparatives involve a preposition de whose com­
                             plement is a degree lo, which in turn is modified by a special relative clause in
                             which it is a gradable property that raises to specCP, hence the label. It is not as
                            immediately clear how to analyze Que Comparatives, which I henceforth refer to as
                             bare clause comparatives, since there is no preposition de or Deg element such as
                             lo (or cuanto) introducing the second associate.
                                     There are two reasonable options at this point. On one hand, we could take
                             bare clause comparatives to constitute a subcase of degree relative comparatives. I
                             will call this the UNIFIED ANALYSIS. Alternatively, we could take bare clause com­
                             paratives to constitute a distinct construction from degree relative comparatives. I
                             will call this the SPLIT ANALYSIS. Each option has its advantages and disadvan­
                             tages, although I opt for the latter.

                            The unified analysis
                                   If we claim that bare clause comparatives are simply a subcase of degree rel­
                             ative comparatives, then we can preserve a unified analysis of ER complementation
                             in Spanish. That is, ER always subcategorizes for both a QP or AP argument, de­
                             noting the compared property, and a prepositional degree argument, denoting the
                             standard of comparison.
                                     There are restrictions on what can separate the comparative particle and the
                             understood base-generated position of the QP or AP whose degree is being com-




                                                                          282

                             pared. Such restrictions hold both in degree relative comparatives and bare clause
                             comparatives.62 In the former, the island effects can be explained by the fact that
                             the compared property AP or QP must raise to the specifier position of the degree
                             relative via A’-movement, a type of movement which is subject to being blocked by
                             island effects. The same restriction could potentially explain the locality constraints
                             in bare clause comparatives if they, too, are a case of degree relative comparatives.
                                      Nevertheless, there are also disadvantages to the unified analysis. First of
                             all, there is no obvious reason why de and the appropriate form of lo are absent in
                             bare clause comparatives if these constitute a subcase of degree relative compara­
                             tives. We would have to stipulate that degree relatives can either be introduced by a
                             preposition (i.e., de) or simply occur as a bare clause with no overt indication of
                             any preposition or the relativized Deg, i.e., the determiner of the relative clause.63
                                      Secondly, bare clause comparatives allow deletion processes such as gap­
                             ping and stripping that are not allowed in degree relative comparatives containing
                             the string de lo que (with or without agreement on lo). We saw earlier that such
                             deletion processes are generally allowed in those conjunction structures containing
                             the type of symmetry traditionally associated with coordination, whereas they are
                             generally disallowed in those less symmetrical conjunction structures traditionally
                             associated with subordination.

                             The split analysis
                                    The objections stated above show that there are also reasons to treat bare
                             clause comparatives as a construction separate from degree relative comparatives.
                             This is in fact the position I will take. I will specifically claim that bare clause com­
                             paratives in Spanish do not involve degree relatives but rather what I term an AD­
                             VERSATIVE CONJUNCTION STRUCTURE. This is what Stassen (1985) refers to as a


                                 62 We will see below, however, that the restrictions involved are not the same in both cases.
                                 63 The head of the relative clause is actually the raised second head, denoting the compared
                             property.




                                                                            283

                             type of comparative construction called a Conjoined Comparative. According to
                            Stassen (p.44), this type of comparison:

                                   is typically effected by means of the adversative coordination of two clauses; one of these
                                   clauses contains the comparee NP, and the other clause contains the standard NP. Further­
                                   more, there is a structural parallelism between the two clauses, to the effect that the gram­
                                   matical function which the comparee NP fulfils in its clause is matched by the grammatical
                                   function of the standard NP in its clause. As a result, this type of comparative involves
                                   two grammatically independent clauses, which are connected in such a way that a gradation
                                   between the two objects can be inferred.

                            Stassen presents two subtypes of the Conjoined Comparative (p.44):
                            (198) [= Stassen’s Type 5A] conjoined comparatives in which the two clauses
                                                               contain antonymous predicates
                            (199) [=Stassen’s Type 5B]          conjoined comparatives in which the comparative
                                                                       predicates in the two clauses exhibit a
                                                                       positive-negative polarity

                                     Stassen gives (200)[=his #22] as an example of the construction in (198)
                            and (201)[=his #23] as an example of the construction in (199) [language name is
                            given in caps]:

                                  ‘Kaywerye is taller than Waraka’
                                     These sentences are parallel to the two following sentences in English, re­
                            spectively:
                            (202) Juan is tall, (but) Pedro is short.                      [antonymous predicates]
                            (203) Juan is tall, (but) Pedro isn’t.                         [positive-negative polarity]
                                     These are not comparative constructions in the sense described in the
                            Introduction, although they are certainly comparisons. I claim in this chapter that




                                                                            284

                             Spanish bare clause comparatives are actually adversative conjunction comparatives
                             of the positive-negative polarity type. This will be developed in detail below.
                                      The split analysis, in which bare clause comparatives involve adversative
                             conjunction rather than a degree relative, removes the need to explain the lack of de
                             and lo in bare clause comparatives, since there is no need for a subordinator-type el­
                             ement like de in a coordination-like structure, and lo is a Deg that denotes a rela­
                             tivized degree. Neither of these two elements is needed if the second associate is
                             merely conjoined to the first clause in a coordination-type construction. Further­
                             more, the split analysis removes the need to explain the ability of bare clause com­
                             parative to undergo deletion processes such as gapping and stripping, which are
                             typically limited to conjunction structures with a high degree of symmetry. As ex­
                             emplified above in (200)-(201), the construction which I call adversative conjunc­
                             tion comparatives are attested cross-linguistically (Stassen (1985)).
                                      The split analysis, however, introduces problems of its own. First of all, if
                             a bare clause comparative involves adversative conjunction rather than a relative
                             clause, we must claim that in even in coordination-type conjunction structures there
                             is some dependency between conjuncts and that ER may optionally subcategorize
                             either for a coordination-type adversative second conjunct or for a degree within a
                             PR I will call this the subcategorization problem. There are certainly other heads
                             which can subcategorize for more than one type of complement, and we will see
                             that in fact, there are other coordination-type conjunction structures in which there
                             is an interdependency between the two conjuncts. Furthermore, the fact that some
                             languages form comparatives exclusively through adversative conjunction construc­
                             tions makes it feasible that such a construction is available in Spanish, even though
                             it is not the only construction available.
                                      Another potential problem for the split analysis is that it necessitates a dis­
                             tinct explanation of locality constraints between the comparative particle and the
                             base-generated position of the understood QP or AP representing the compared




                                                                           285

                             property in bare clause comparatives. A degree relative comparative involves A’-
                             movement of the QP or AP involved, but it is not obvious that a bare clause com­
                             parative does if it is merely a second conjunct in a coordinate-type conjunction
                             structure. I will show that in fact there are other movements that are involved
                             which explain the locality restraints involved in bare clause comparatives, and
                             hence, the locality problem does not favor the unification of degree relative compar­
                             atives and bare clause relatives. As a matter of fact, the locality constraints are not
                             the same in degree relative comparatives and bare clause relatives. I will call the
                             need to characterize a distinct locality condition for bare clause comparatives the LO­
                            CALITY PROBLEM.


                            5.2.2.2 The subcategorization problem
                                     Recall from Chapter 3 that if ER occurs in a sentence without a second asso­
                             ciate, the sentence is felt to be missing something. Consider, for example, the sen­
                             tence in (204):
                             (204) #Juan    comprd          mds                        libros.64
                                   Juan buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.m.pl                      books
                                   ‘Juan bought more books’
                                     This sentence is not ungrammatical but is felt to be elliptical. It is preferable
                             for there to be an overt second associate, introduced either by de or que in Spanish:
                             (205) Juan comprd               mds       libros de I-[]-o-s

                             (206) Juan comprd               mds      de cinco libros.
                                   Juan buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.rn.pl of five books
                                   ‘Juan bought more than five books’
                             (207) Juan comprd              mds        libros que yo.

                                   ‘Juan bought more books than I did’
                                  84 As pointed out to me by Pamela Munro (p.c.), this sentence is grammatical if given a con­
                             text, e.g., if mds means ‘additional’. However, the sentence is elliptical and needs a context




                                                                           286

                                     I have claimed that a standard of comparison introduced by de is a PP com­
                             plement to ER. Under the split hypothesis, a standard of comparison introduced by
                             que is conjoined with what precedes it in a symmetric, coordination-type construc­
                             tion. This is a problem under the standard assumption that complements are intro­
                             duced via subordination and not via coordination. On one level, we could simply
                             dismiss this problem immediately by saying that since subordination and coordina­
                             tion do not differ in their external structure, any requirement demanding that a com­
                             plement be a subordinate element must be discarded. Nevertheless, a que second
                             associate is not like most complements in that most complements are not on a sym­
                             metric level with the clause containing the head that subcategorizes for them, so it is
                             worthwhile to investigate the matter.
                                     A second associate in a bare clause comparative is certainly not an adjunct,
                             since if that were the case, we would expect a bare clause comparative to still ex­
                             press a complete proposition even if its second associate were removed. On the
                             contrary, a bare clause comparative would be elliptical (cf. (204) above) without its
                             second associate. Furthermore, we would expect it to be possible for there to be
                             both a degree relative and a bare clause if the former is a complement and the latter
                             is an adjunct, but this is not the case (208)-(209), since adjuncts can usually cooc­
                             cur with complements (210) [hypothetical complements underlined, hypothetical
                             adjuncts double-underlined]:

                                      Instead, following Sdez (1993), I will take a bare clause second associate to
                             stand in the same relationship to the clause preceding it (211) as a clause beginning
                             with ni ‘nor’ does to the clause preceding it in correlative conjunction
                             (‘neither.. .nor... ’) (212) or as a clause beginning with y ‘and’ (in the sense of
                             ‘both’) does to the clause preceding it (213) in correlative conjunction

                                      In any of these three sentences, removal of the second conjunct creates a
                             sentence which seems incomplete or different in meaning:
                             (214)     #Juan    comprd         mds                     libros.

                                      ‘Juan bought more books’

                             (215)     # Ni comprd       Juan libros.65

                                      ‘And Juan bought books’
                                     Dominique Sportiche suggests (p.c.) that if coordination involves any de­
                             pendency relationship between the two conjuncts at all, it is a special type of cooc­
                             currence requirement between the highest element in each respective conjunct
                             Thus, in (212) and (213), we would say that there is a dependency relationship be­
                             tween the two occurrences of ni and y, respectively.
                                 65 This sentence is grammatical but only under irrelevant readings in which ni means ‘not
                             even’, such as ‘Juan didn’t even buy BOOKS’, ‘Not even JUAN bought books’, etc.




                                                                           288

                                      I adopt Sdez’s (1993) claim that mds and que in (211) are also interdepen­
                             dent. Even though mds does not appear to be the highest element in the first con­
                            junct at S-str, it is reasonable to claim that it raises to a higher position at LF for
                            purposes of quantifier raising (May (1985)).
                                      Although the details of Sdez’s (1993) account are somewhat different from
                             mine, I present his proposal first and subsequently turn to mine. I begin with the
                            structures that Sdez gives for the nominal system and the verba] system in his pro­
                            posal. For the nominal system, he takes mds to head a QP in the specifier of DP,
                            and DP to be the complement of an AgrP (217).“ As for the verbal system, he
                            takes VP to be a complement of T, and TP, in turn, is a complement of Agr (218),
                            AgrP being the highest projection other than CP according to Chomsky (1989).67

                                      Sdez claims that at LF, mas adjoins to the AgrP nearest to and higher than it,
                             whether this AgrP is part of nominal agreement or clausal agreement From there,
                             mds moves to successively higher and higher AgrP’s, as long as no definite NP
                             boundary, no CP boundary, nor any instance of a functional category that he tenta-


                                  66 Sdez attributes this last part of the structure to class notes by Esther Torrego (Spring 1990,
                             institution and course not mentioned).
                                  67 Sdez bases this structure on Pollock (1987) and Chomsky (1989). [In the references section
                             of his manuscript, Sdez only gives the names and years of these two sources].

                             eventual landing site, mds must c-command que, or else the sentence is not gram­
                             matical. This follows from Suez’s claim that comparative que is a polarity item
                             which must be licensed by mds.68
                                      The exact mechanism that Sdez proposes for mds raising is not entirely com­
                             patible with assumptions I make, since he takes mds in amount comparisons to be a
                             quantifier in the specifier of DP, whereas I consider mds in amount comparisons to
                             be the manifestation of the degree ER plus its Q complement MUCH, which in turn
                             itself takes an NP complement. Nevertheless, his proposal at first glance seems to
                             account very well for the scope of mds. For example, it correctly predicts (219) to
                             be grammatical and (220) to be ungrammatical:
                             (219) Juan les          dijo      a      mds          personas [que iba

                                   ‘Juan said that more people came to the party than I did’
                                      According to Sdez’s proposal, the derivation of these two sentences should
                             be as follows. The word mds in (219) raises at LF first to the specifier of the AgrP
                             corresponding to personas, and subsequently, it raises to the specifier position of
                             the matrix AgrP. From that position it c-commands and hence licenses que, which,
                             as I mentioned earlier, Sdez takes to be a polarity item.
                                      In (220), mds moves to the specifier of the AgrP corresponding to per­
                             sonas and then to the specifier of the subordinate AgrP, but from there, it cannot

                             raise any higher since it cannot cross a CP boundary.
                                      It is not clear why mds, if it is indeed a quantifier, should not be able, via
                             quantifier movement (May (1985)), to raise to specCP in the matrix. In fact, al­
                             though mds usually behaves as a clause-bound element,70it is not actually the case
                             that mds cannot ever cross a CP boundary. Consider, for example, the following
                             sentence:
                             (221) Josd piensa que yo                  soy mds alt-o de lo
                                   Josd think.3sg that lsg.nom be.lsg ER tall-m of the.n
                                           que soy de verdad.
                                           that be.lsg of truth
                                   ‘Jos6 thinks that I am taller than I really am’71

                                      In (221), mds takes scope over the verb piensa,11which it can only do if it
                             raises out of the CP complement of piensa, under the assumption that an element
                             can only have scope over another element if at some syntactic level the former c-
                             commands the latter (cf. May (1985)).
                                     Recall from Chapter 4 that I do not take mds to be a quantifier. Neverthe­
                             less, we can assume that there is some position within an articulated complementiz­
                             er system (cf. Rizzi (1995), also discussed below) to which the projection contain­
                             ing ER and the compared property can raise at LF, rather than raising to IP. I will

                                  70 Saez (1993) also discusses the fact that certain nominals are opaque to mds:
                                  (i) [=his (141a.)]       *L-a construccion de        mds         iglesias que de tabemas...
                                                           the-f construction of ER.MUCH.f.pi churches that of taverns
                                                           ‘The construction of more churches than taverns...’
                                  In order for (i) to be grammatical, mds would have to c -c o m m and que at some point in the
                             derivation. However, the nominal la construccidn.. .iglesias acts as a barrier for mds, and hence,
                             the sentence is ungrammatical.
                                  Thus, mds is also nominal-bound in some cases, too.
                                  71 This example is based on a famous dialogue attributed by Von S techow (1984, p.5) to
                             Russell (1905):
                                  Guest:                  I thought your yacht was larger than it is.
                                  Yacht owner:            No, my yacht is not larger than it is.
                                  The yacht owner’s answer addresses areading of the guest’s comment that he or she probably
                             did not intend. Under that reading, the guest would be confessing to having had an absurd thought,
                             the one expressed by the yacht owner.
                                  721 am referring to the non-absurd reading. Under the absurd reading, mds takes narrow scope
                             with respect to the verb piensa.




                                                                            291

                             assume that the reason why mds cannot raise across a CP boundary in (220), even
                             though it can in (221), is that the intended scope of the matrix predicate in (220) is
                             wider than that of mds, and hence, mds must not raise higher than it. In any case,
                             we see that for a sentence to be grammatical, mds must raise to a position from
                             which it can c-command, and hence license, the que second associate, assuming
                             that doing so will not result in an unintended or incoherent scopal relation between
                             mds and some other predicate.
                                      Of course, even though mds can cross some clause boundaries, we will see
                             below that islands to wh-movement are also barriers for mds.
                                      I consider the raising of mds to a high position at LF in order to license the
                             que second associate73 to be analogous to the raising of negation to a high position
                             at LF in cases of coordination-type conjunction of the following type, similar to the
                             type discussed by Sdez (1993):74
                             (222) Juan no    comid, ni         comid     Marfa
                                   Juan not eat.pret.3sg nor eat.pret.3sg Marfa
                                   ‘Juan didn’t eat, nor did Marid’
                                     The second conjunct must be licensed by no in the first conjunct, since
                             without it, the second conjunct may not appear
                             (223) *Juan comid,         ni      comid Maria.
                                    Juan eat.pret.3sg nor eat.pret.3sg Maria
                                   ‘Juan ate, nor did Marfa eat’
                                      We can see, then, that mds and que have a relationship very similar to pairs

                             scopal reasons. Thus, ER would raise for reasons of its own rather than simply in order to license
                             the que second associate. This would satisfy Chomksy’s principle of Greed (1993).

                            5.2.2.3 The locality problem
                            5.2.23.1 Defining the locality conditions in Spanish bare clause comparatives
                                     In bare clause comparatives in Spanish not only must the Deg that is under­
                            stood to modify the compared property AP or QP be covert but also most of the re­
                            maining elements understood to be present semantically in the bare clause, too. The
                            one exception to this is the case of comparative subdeletion with a preposed second
                            head, as in (224) [=111-155]:
                            (224)    Felipe lav6                    mds      coches que camionetas
                                      Felipe wash.pret.3sg MUCH.m.pl.ER cars that pick.up.trucks
                                                    lav<5       Rodrigo.
                                                wash.pret.3sg Rodrigo
                                       ‘Felipe washed more cars than Rodrigo washed pick-up trucks’
                                     Sdez (1993) is the only native speaker of Spanish that I have found who ac­
                            cepts bare clause cases of comparative subdeletion with regular word order as in
                            (225) below:
                            (225)     Felipe lav6                    mds      coches que Rodrigo
                                      Felipe wash.pret.3sg MUCH.m.pI.ER cars          that Rodrigo
                                                  lav6      camionetas.
                                             wash.pret.3sg pick-up.trucks
                                       ‘Felipe washed more cars than Rodrigo washed pick-up trucks’
                                    Most speakers choose instead the construction in (224), also accepted by
                            Sdez. Sdez claims that this construction has the same structure as degree relative
                            comparatives. I will not address this issue, however, but instead refer the interest­
                            ed reader to Sdez (1990, for example).
                                    As far as all other types of bare clause comparatives in Spanish are consid­
                            ered, however, we only have indirect evidence there there is really an entire clause
                            in the second associate. For example comparative deletion is not possible in a bare
                            clause comparative:




                                                                         293

                             hypothetical underlying bare clause comparative exhibiting comparative deletion
                             (226) *Juan      comprd         mds          manzanas que tu vendiste           []

                                 ‘Juan bought more apples than you sold’
                                      The way in which comparative deletion is actually manifested in Spanish is
                             in the form of a degree relative comparative:
                             (227) Juan compr6              mds         manzanas de    l-[]-a-s
                                    Juan buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl       apples of the-MUCH-f-pl
                                          que      tu     vendiste.
                                          that 2sg.nom sell.pret.2sg
                                   ‘Juan bought more apples than you sold’
                                      There are, however, surface structures which seem to derive from a source
                             with the same type of underlying structure as (226).7i For example, recall from
                             Chapter 3 that if the verb in each conjunct is identical, then a reduced bare clause
                            may surface in the form of gapping, a construction which I introduced in that chap­
                             ter as comparative gapping:
                            comparative gapping
                            (228) Juan comid             mds           manzanas que    tu    peras.76
                                  Juan eat.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl         apples that 2sg.nom pears
                                  ‘Juan ate more apples than you, pears’
                                      If everything but one phrasal constituent is identical in each conjunct, then
                            comparative ellipsis usually results instead (229), which I take to be a specific in­
                            stance of stripping - the result of stripping applied to a sentence such as (226):
                             stripping
                             (229) Juan comid               mds                     manzanas que    tti
                                     Juan eat.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl                  apples that 2sg.nom
                                     ‘Juan ate more apples than you’
                                      Thus, I will assume that the locality requirements between que and the gap
                             of hypothetical Spanish bare clause comparatives such as in (226) can be deduced


                                  75 The sentences in (228) and (229) do not have the exact same underlying sentence as (226)
                             since some of the lexical items are different. I have adjusted the lexical items in each case so that
                             the number and types of contrasts are appropriate to the construction at hand.
                                  78 Recall from Chapter 3 that although some speakers of English disallow comparative gap­
                             ping, comparative gapping in Spanish is uncontroversially grammatical.




                                                                              294

                             from the behavior of analogous, actually occurring sentences involving gapping or
                             stripping.
                                     The English translation of (226) shows that English comparative deletion,
                             as opposed to Spanish comparative deletion, does take the form of a bare clause
                             comparative. Note that in such a structure, there is a locality constraint between
                             than and the position of the second head of the comparison,77here the abstract
                            MUCH. The word than and the second head of a comparison may not be separated
                            by any domains which are opaque to A’-movement, such as a complex noun phrase
                             (230), a wh-island (231), an adjunct (232), or a sentential subject (233).78
                                     A complex noun phrase is a nominal expression which includes either a rel­
                             ative clause (230a) or a complement clause to a noun (230b). Such complement
                            clauses and all relative clauses are barriers to A’-movement according to Ross’s
                            (1967) Complex Noun Phrase Constraint:
                             (230) a.     *Juan bought more apples than I saw [the girls [whoj tj found [ e]]]
                                   b.     *Juan bought more apples than I resent [the fact that Pedro sold [e ]].
                                     Wh-islands are also a barrier to A’-movement and block the appropriate
                            local relationship between than and the base-generated position of the covert second
                            head:
                            (231) *Juan bought more apples than I asked [whyj Pedro sold [ e ] tj ].

                                     Adjunct clauses, which block A’-movement, such as the temporal clause in
                            (232) also interfere with the locality requirement under discussion:
                            (232) *Juan bought more apples than I left the market [after Pedro sold [ e ]] .

                                     Lastly, sentential subjects such as the one in (233) are also islands for A’-


                                 77 I use the symbol [e] in the following examples as a placeholder for the gap corresponding
                            to the covert second head without m a k in g a claim as to whether or not the second head actually
                            moves. I do claim, however, that in the case of the contrast or contrasts, there is movement to a
                            focus projection.
                                 7“ The domains which are barriers to A’-movement are indicated by (the outermost) square
                            brackets [ ].




                                                                           295

                             (233) *Juan bought more apples than [that Pedro sold [ e ]] is surprising.
                                       However, outside of these constraints, the distance between the word than
                             and the gap is in principle79unbounded (234)-(236), although processing difficul­
                             ties arise after a certain degree of embedding (236):
                             (234) Juan bought more apples than [you said [that Pedro sold [e]]].
                             (235) Juan bought more apples than [I could swear [that you said [that Pedro sold
                                        [e])]].
                             (236) ?Juan bought more apples than [I could swear [that you asked me [to get
                                        Pedro [to say that [Elisa sold [e ]]]]]].

                                       This is true as long as the subcategorization requirements of mds that we
                             saw earlier can be met - mds must be able to c-command que. Thus, even if mds is
                             embedded within a complement clause in the first associate, for example, as long as
                             the matrix predicate, such as thought in (237), can take narrow scope with respect
                             to mds:
                             (237) Juan thought that you had bought more apples than we eventually all found
                                         out [that you really did buy [e]]].
                                       The locality constraint between the Spanish comparative particle que and the
                             hypothetical position of the gap in an instance of comparative gapping or compara­
                             tive stripping (i.e., comparative ellipsis), which I take to be surface realizations of
                             an underlying bare clause, turn out to be even tighter than the islands effects seen




                                  79 There are certain other factors involved here, although I will not discuss them as that is be­
                             yond the scope of this work. As an example, though, Pamela Munro offers (p.c.) the following
                             sentence as ungrammatical, even though it violates no principles mentioned in the text:
                                  (i) *Juan bought more apples th an [you were surprised [that Pedro sold [el]].
                                  I actually take this sentence to be somewhat grammatical, but the point that grammaticality of
                             these types of sentences is weakened by increasing complications in structure or inclusion of cer­
                             tain particular predicates is a well taken one.




                                                                             296

                             directly in the case of English bare clause comparatives,80as we will see presently.81
                                     First of all, those structures functioning as islands in English bare clause
                             comparatives, i.e., the structures that are expected to function as islands to wh-
                             movement, such as degree relatives, also do so in the case of bare clause compara­
                             tives. That is, the comparative particle que and the hypothetical base-generated po­
                             sition of the covert second head in an instance of comparative gapping or compara­
                             tive stripping cannot be separated across barriers to wh-movement.82
                                     If, for example, the first head is embedded within a wh-island, so is mds.
                             This is the case because: (i) mds either includes the second head if the second head
                             is MUCH, or takes the second head as its complement if the second head is an ad­
                            jective or adverb, and (ii), even though mds can raise out of some CP’s, it cannot
                             escape wh-islands. Therefore, in order for mds to license the que clause, i.e., the
                             entire second associate, the second associate must be located within that wh-island
                             as well, including the comparative particle que and the second head (as well as the
                             contrast within the second associate). Even though the second associate is highly
                             elliptical, and both the second head and other material that would help us elaborate
                             the structure of the second associate are covert, we know that both the comparative
                             particle que and the second head are interpreted within the wh-island since only the
                             interpretation denoted by a structure in which they are both within the wh-island is
                             acceptable. The interpretation denoted by a structure in which que is located outside

                                 80 Recall that whereas Spanish bare clause comparatives may not contain a verb and hence are
                            only assumed to be clauses based on their interpretation, a second associate with a virtually full
                            overt clausal structure may appear after than in English. It may be, of course, that some or all of
                            English than comparatives involve degree relatives, although there is no overt equivalent to
                            Spanish de in such cases (unless than is taken to be that equivalent (cf. Napoli (1983), for exam­
                            ple), in which case there is no equivalent to Spanish que in such constructions), nor is there an
                            overt equivalent to Spanish lo in such cases. I remain neutral as to whether or not the second head
                            undergoes movement in second associates in English comparatives.
                                 81 Material shown in parenthesis in the following examples does not surface but appears to be
                            present underlyingly based on the semantic properties of the second associate.
                                 82 In the following examples, the word than and the hypothetical base-generated position of the
                            second head are given in boldface, and the first word of constituents functioning as barriers are un­
                            derlined.

                                     These locality conditions are due to the subcategorization properties between
                             ER and the comparative particle (i.e., between ER and the second associate).
                                     In addition to these locality conditions, which English bare clause compara­
                             tives are subject to,85degree relative comparatives in Spanish would be expected to
                             be subject to, and Spanish bare clause comparatives are subject to, bare clause com­

                                     For example, the sentence in (242) is unproblematic, since the hypothetical
                             position of the gap is not separated from que by any clausal boundaries.

                             without agreement on lo) and the position of the gap in degree relative comparatives
                             in Spanish is subject to island effects, as expected, but not clausal embedding in
                             general (244), just as we saw was the case for the locality constraint between than
                             and the position of the gap in English than comparatives (cf. (234)-(236) and
                             (245)):

                                       Furthermore, the sentence in (244) simultaneously demonstrates another
                             difference between degree relative comparatives and bare clause comparatives with
                             regards to locality restrictions. It demonstrates that degree relative comparatives

                                      In bare clause comparatives, on the other hand, it is not possible to separate

                             second associate across a clause boundary. In the following example, only the first
                             interpretation is possible, since in the second interpretation, there would be a clause
                             boundary between que and the hypothetical base-generated position of tu, i.e., the

                             ones in de lo que comparatives. This supports my proposal that bare clause com­
                             paratives are not a subcase of degree relative comparatives. What remains to be ex­
                             plained is why bare clause comparatives involve locality conditions at all despite the
                             absence of a relative clause structure.



                                  88 The second associate contrast is Pedro in this example.
                                  87 In the following examples, the adverbial expression con mdsfrecuencia ‘more often’ should
                             be talren to modify the verb decir (in its various forms) rather than the embedded verb ser.

                             5.2.2.3.2 Explaining the Spanish locality conditions
                                      The solution that I propose essentially combines two proposals: Saez’s
                             (1993) proposal regarding second associate contrasts in comparatives and Rizzi’s
                             (1995) articulated CP proposal.
                                      Sdez (1993, p. 13) reports the following proposal made by Pesetsky (1982):
                             “the correspondents in a coordinate structure... move to Comp at LF.. .just as wh-
                             in-situ constituents in an interrogative sentence do... ”88
                                      Although S£ez does not report any definition that Pesetsky may have given
                             for the term correspondents, I assume that Pesetksy takes correspondents in a coor­
                             dinate structure to be those elements in the second of two conjoined clauses which
                             have parallel functions in their respective clauses and which contrast with one an­
                             other. For example, in (247), Mary is one correspondent, corresponding to the
                             subject John of the first clause, and the record is a second correspondent, corre­
                             sponding to the direct object the book in the first clause. The structure of (247a) is
                             given in (247b):
                             (247)    a.       John bought the book, and Mary, the record,
                                      b.       cp[Johnj the bookj jp[ej bought ej]]
                                               and
                                               CpfMaryjj the recordj [e^ (bought) ej]]

                                      In (247b), we see that the correspondents in the second clause have risen to
                             clause-initial position, which Pesetksy takes to be Comp but which I take to be the
                             specifier position of a focus projection.89 Sdez claims that in this example the corre­
                             spondents that have moved to Comp at LF undergo absorption in the same way that
                             two wh-elements as in (248) do, along the lines of Higginbotham and May (1981):
                             (248) a.          Who bought what ?
                                   b.          Qp[whOj whatj jp[ej bought ej]]

                                 “ The ellipses indicate omission of example numbers from S5ez (1993).
                                 “ They are both associated with a single focus projection but not in a ternary structure.
                             Rather, one of the contrasts is actually in the specifier position of the other - this is a Kayne
                             (1994) style interpretation of a traditional adjunction structure.




                                                                              302

                                       Absorption is the combination of n-many independent operators into one
                             n-ary operator, specifically a binary operator in the examples at hand.
                                      Sdez extends Pesetsky’s claim regarding the correspondents in a non-com­
                             parative coordination structure to the correspondents in what he calls COORDINATE
                             COMPARATIVES,      which correspond to what I have labelled bare clause compara­
                             tives). Thus, the LF representations for (249) and (251) [Sdez’s examples #28a
                             and #44, respectively, glosses and translations mine] are as in (250) and (252), re­
                             spectively [based on his examples #64a and #64b, respectively]:

                                     Note that for Sdez, raising to Comp means adjunction to IP. I instead
                             choose to characterize the raising of the element ER and the raising of the contrast
                             or contrasts in each associate within the schema proposed by Rizzi (1995), which is
                             in line with the overall framework discussed in Chapter 1.
                                     Rizzi (1995) proposes an articulated structure for the outermost portion of
                             clauses, with what he terms force as the outermost / highest projection, followed by
                             at most one focus interspersed with possibly several topics, all followed by the
                             finiteness projection. In brief, the element ER in the matrix raises to the specifier
                             position of one of the projections in the articulated matrix CP, most likely specCP
                             itself given its quantifier-like nature. Secondly, the contrast or contrasts in each re-

                            spective term of comparison carries a feature [+Foc] which must be checked by the
                            head of the focus projection proposed by Rizzi in its own associate, called FocP,
                            which also carries the feature [+Foc]. If there is more than one contrast in each as­
                            sociate, then contrasts are stacked, one located directly in specFocP, the next locat­
                            ed in the specifier of the contrast located directly in specFocP, and so on. Feature-
                            checking is accomplished via spec-head agreement.
                                     Consider the following example:
                            (253) Josd comprd           mds           libros que Fernando.
                                  Josd buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.rn.pl books that Fernando
                                  ‘Jose bought more books than Fernando’
                                     In this sentence, Fernando is the focus of contrast, since it is as a function
                            of him that we arrive at a number of books, namely the amount of books that he
                            bought, which serves as the starting point from which to measure the amount of
                            books that Josd bought. In fact, there is a de lo que construction with the same in­
                            terpretation as (254):
                            (254) Josd compn5          mds           libros de  l-[ ]-o-s que
                                  Jose buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.rn.plbooks of the-MUCH-m-pl that
                                          compr6      Fernando.
                                         buy.pret.3sg Fernando
                                  ‘Jose bought more books than Fernando bought’
                                     If we were to claim that (254) is the source of (253), we would have to ex­
                            plain why the unit de los and the second verb compro are covert in (253). Although
                            this type of solution would allow a syntactic unification between the semantically
                            related que and de lo que comparatives in Spanish, it would require ad hoc stipula­
                            tions.
                                     I propose, instead, that (253) involves (255), with the interpretation indicat­
                            ed, as its source instead of (254), the string in parentheses either base-generated
                            null or deleted at some point in the derivation:

                                     The symbol x here, as opposed to in degree relatives, represents a semantic
                             degree denoted by a covert Deg such as very, so, or as, not defined clearly in terms
                             of the actual amount of books bought by Fernando. In a degree relative, on the
                             other hand, such a position is occupied instead by a covert Deg representing the ac­
                             tual degree to which the element or elements constituting the second term hold the
                             compared property.
                                     It is not clear whether Fernando, the focus of contrast, raises to specFocP
                             before or after Spellout, since the string in brackets is null by Spellout and hence
                             cannot be used to diagnose the position of Fernando at Spellout In either case,
                             Fernando must raise to specFocP by Spellout, yielding an LF as in (256):

                                     By adopting the source sentence in (255), I am proposing an adversative
                             conjunction structure, discussed earlier in this section, syntactically resembling cer­
                             tain comparative types found in other languages in the world and semantically re­
                             sembling one of the interpretations that has been proposed for comparatives in gen­
                             eral. The type of interpretation I am referring to is that attributed to Seuren (1973)
                             by Breivik (1991) as demonstrated in (259) for the sentence in (258):
                             (258) [=Breivik’s #1]
                                   Jim is taller than Joe.

                                     Breivik claims that the following two claims are central to Seuren’s analysis

                                 00 I assume that Breivik is referring to comparatives in which the second associate is intro­
                             duced by a comparative particle. I refer the interested reader to Stassen (1985) for a dassificatory
                             system of world comparative types, including particle comparatives.

                             polarity constructions in comparatives in these languages nevertheless makes it rea­
                             sonable to claim that such a construction exists, even somewhat disguised, in other
                             languages such as Spanish. I claim that Spanish comparatives such as (253) have a
                             similar or identical underlying structure (cf. (255)).
                                      The examples in (261) and (262) appear to be instances of stripping, since
                             there are no overt constituents of the second clause other than a focus of contrast, a
                             negative element, and in the case of (261), a conjunction. Hence they are even
                             more similar to the Spanish example in (253) than the others.
                                      So in (255), the element que is a coordinator-type conjunction, accompanied
                             by a covert negative morpheme, together functioning in a manner somewhat similar
                             to English but or whereas. An English paraphrase of (255) is given in (266):
                             (266) Josd bought more books, whereas Fernando didn’t buy (as/so/very)92many
                                        books.
                                      We have seen that in Spanish bare clause comparatives, que and the hypo­
                             thetical base-generated position of the second associate contrast may not be separat­
                             ed by a clausal boundary, nor may que and the second head within the second asso­
                             ciate be separated by a clausal boundary. It is only the former restriction which fol­
                             lows from the raising of the contrast that I propose. The latter restriction is proba­
                             bly an epiphenomenon resulting from the former restriction. The relevant restric­
                             tion follows from my proposal that the second associate contrast or contrasts, in­
                             cluding the second head if different than the first head, must raise at LF to
                             specFocP. This movement is clause-bound, as opposed to wh-movement.
                                      Although there is not an entire overt clause present to diagnose how far a
                             contrast within the second associate of a bare clause comparative has raised, we can
                             reconstruct what the proposed clause should consist of based on the interpretation
                             that is implied by overt elements in the matrix clause, as I stated earlier.
                                      Another important question arises at this point - why is the clause out of
                                  02 I don’t have enough information to decide which of these three Deg’s is the most appropriate
                             in this paraphrase.




                                                                            307

                             which the focus of contrast raises obligatorily covert ? A tentative answer is that
                             there is some principal of economy by which repetition of material in general is
                             avoided. In comparatives, this means that repetition of elements in the second asso­
                            ciate that are also elements in the first associate, i.e., either the second head, if non-
                            distinct from the first head, and/or the common ground, is avoided if possible.
                             Contrasts, on the other hand, must always be overt, both to receive focus and in
                            order to provide material that would be unrecoverable unless entirely clear from
                            context. In (267), the common ground elements pasa and tiempo, the second head
                            MUCH, and the understood negative element no are covert in the second associate,
                            whereas the two contrasts in the second associate, Fernando and en el gimnasio, are
                            both overt. A post-Spellout stage of (267) is given in (268) [covert elements are
                            given in outline font]:
                            (267) Gonzalo pasa           mds        tiempo en 1-a biblioteca que
                                  Gonzalo pass.3sg ER.MUCH.m time in the-f library that
                                        Fernando en el       gimnasio.
                                        Fernando in the.m gym
                                  ‘Gonzalo spends more time in the library than Fernando (does) in the gym’
                            (268) Gonzalo pasa            mds     tiempo en            1-a biblioteca que Femandoj
                                  Gonzalo pass.3sg ER.MUCH.m time in                   the-f library that Fernando
                                        [en el gimnasio]j, tj elq pasa                 madia-[ ]-o tiempo tj.
                                        in the.m gym           not pass.3sg            very-MUCH-m time

                                     As we saw before, this is an instance of gapping, which also occurs in non­
                            comparatives. Hence, in the following non-comparative instance of gapping, we
                            also see that the common ground, pasa los sabados, is covert, whereas the contrasts
                            in the second clause, Fernando and en el gimnasio, are overt:
                            (269) Gonzalo pasa           1-o-s    sdbados en 1-a biblioteca, y Femandoj
                                  Gonzalo spend3sg the-m-pl Saturdays in the-f library and Fernando
                                      [en el gimnasio]j, tj pass I=o-s              g&toados     tj.
                                       in the.m gym            pass.3sg the-m-pl Saturdays
                                   ‘Gonzalo spends Saturdays in the library, and Fernando in the gym’
                                     Since stripping occurs in both comparative and non-comparative sentences,




                                                                         308

                             one would expect that a non-comparative version (271) of a sentence like (270),
                             which is an example of comparative ellipsis should be allowed, but it is not:
                             (270) Pedro tiene         mds        dinero que Fernando.
                                   Pedro have.3sg ER.MUCH.m money that Fernando
                                   ‘Pedro has more money than Fernando’
                             (271) *Pedro tiene        much-[]-o     dinero y Fernando.
                                   Pedro have.3sg very-MUCH-m money and Fernando
                                   ‘Pedro has a lot of money, and Fernando (has a lot of money)’
                                     First, note that there are languages which do allow sentences like (69), for
                             example, Dutch (Rijkhoek (1996)):
                             [Rijkhoek’s #8a]
                             (272) Mannen bewonderen deze film (,) en vrouwen.
                                      men     admire this movie and women
                                    ‘Men admire this movie, and women (do, too)’

                                     Second, even Spanish permits structures more or less like (271) as long as
                             there is another element present to mark whether the contrast in the second conjunct
                             holds the shared property in the same or the opposite orientation as the contrast in
                             the first conjunct:
                             (273) a.        Pedro tiene         much-[ ]-o    dinero y Fernando tambien.
                                             Pedro have.3sg very-MUCH-m money and Fernando also
                                             ‘Pedro has a lot of money, and Fernando, too’
                                     b.      Pedro no     tiene much-[]-o        dinero v Fernando tampoco.
                                             Pedro not have.3sg very-MUCH-m money and Fernando either
                                             ‘Pedro doesn’t have a lot of money, and Fernando, either’
                                     c.      Pedro tiene         much-[]-o         dinero pero Fernando no.
                                             Pedro have.3sg very-MUCH-m money but Fernando not
                                             ‘Pedro has a lot of money, but not Fernando’
                                     d.      Pedro no     tiene        much-[]-o dinero pero Fernando sf-
                                             Pedro not have.3sg very-MUCH-m money but Fernando yes
                                             ‘Pedro doesn’t have a lot of money, but Fernando does’
                                     In (273a) and (273b), Fernando shares the same orientation as Pedro with
                             respect to the property of having a lot of money. Although I do not explore com­
                             parisons of equality in depth here, I propose that tanto and tan poco, respectively,




                                                                         309

                             ly, are equivalent to mucho...y ...tambien and no...mucho...y...tampoco, respec­
                             tively:
                             (274) a.          Pedro tiene      tanto         dinerocomo Fernando.

                                              ‘Pedro has as little money as Fernando’
                                       (273c) and (273d), on the other hand, are the relevant cases analogous to
                             comparisons of inequality - comparisons of superiority and inferiority, respectively:
                             (275) a.          Pedro tiene      mds            dineroque Fernando.
                                              Pedro have.3sg ER.MUCH.m money that Fernando
                                              ‘Pedro has more money than Fernando’
                                       b.     Pedro tiene          menos           dinero que Fernando.
                                              Pedro have.3sg ER.NEG.MUCH.m money that Fernando
                                              ‘Pedro has less money than Fernando’
                                       Hence mds.. .que and menos.. .que are roughly equivalent to mucho.. .pero
                             no.. .mucho (comparison of superiority) and no mucho.. .pero si.. .mucho (compar­
                             ison of inferiority), respectively. It is left to be explained why the understand ele­
                             ments cannot surface exactly as such, other than the availability of an overt no in
                             the second associate of comparisons of inequality in certain dialects:
                             (276) a.         Pedro tiene       mds            dinero que no Fernando.
                                              Pedro have.3sg ER.MUCH.m money that no Fernando
                                              ‘Pedro has more money than Fernando’
                                       b.     Pedro tiene          menos           dinero que no Fernando.
                                              Pedro have.3sg ER.NEG.MUCH.m money that no Fernando
                                              ‘Pedro has less money than Fernando’
                                       Hence, there is something different about this structure from that involved
                             in generic coordination with pero. Nevertheless, this is at least a step in the right
                             direction in showing that a conjunction may occur in Spanish followed by only a
                             focus of contrast and a polarity marker, without the full clause being present.

                            5.2.3 Spanish second associates: conclusion
                                     We have seen those second associates in Spanish comparatives that begin
                            with de, followed by a form of lo, and then by que are prepositional complement to
                            ER in which the complement of the preposition de is a Deg, modified by a degree
                            relative. On the other hand, bare clause comparatives in Spanish involve a coordi­
                            nation-type conjunction structure in which the first associate is conjoined to a most­
                            ly covert second associate whose overt members hold the properties held by their
                            corresponding contrasts in the first associate in the opposite orientation.

                            5.3 Extension of Analysis to SLQZ
                            5.3.1 Brief review of the data
                                     We concluded in §5.2 that Spanish comparatives in which the comparative
                            particle is de have a different structure than those in which the comparative particle
                            is que. The former group consists of both degree relative comparatives and those
                            comparatives in which the standard of comparison is a simple, unmodified amount,
                            quantity or measure phrase. The latter group, i.e., those comparatives with the
                            comparative particle que, is not entirely homogeneous (cf. subset comparatives in
                            Ch. 3, for example), but I have studied in this chapter a type which I refer to as ad­
                            versative conjoined comparatives. I rejected a unified analysis by which both
                            groups of comparatives would ultimately derive from the same structure and have
                            instead opted for a split analysis, by which each group of comparatives constitutes a
                            fundamentally distinct construction.
                                     SLQZ presents a somewhat different pattern from Spanish, although I claim
                            a split analysis for SLQZ, too. We saw in Chapter 3 that those comparatives in
                            which the standard of comparison is a simple, unmodified amount, quantity or mea­
                            sure phrase require the use of the comparative particle ta ’ (preceded by maaz) or one
                            of its allomorphs presented in Chapter 3,” whereas neither those comparatives cor­
                            responding to Spanish degree relative comparatives nor those corresponding to
                            Spanish adversative conjoined comparatives allow the use of that particle. Instead,
                            the former group requires the particle cah followed by the relative pronoun nih,
                            whereas the latter group requires the use of either the particle cah94or the particle
                            lohoh.95
                                     These are exemplified again here for the convenience of the

                                 931 refer the reader to Chapter 3 for the various forms that ta’ may take. At this point in my
                            research, I have not yet found any principled way of determining which allomoiph this particle will
                            take, if in fact this is not a case of free variation.
                                 94 Also, as noted in Chapter 3, this particle has another allomorph, queh.
                                 95 The use o f lohoh is only allowed under a limited set of circumstances, as mentioned in
                            Chapter 3.




                                                                           312

                            5.3.2 The comparative particles -ta’ and cah (nih)
                                      The sentences in (277), (278) on the one hand, and the sentence in (279),
                             on the other hand, do not use the same comparative particle, even though the analo­
                             gous sentences in Spanish do (they all use the comparative particle de). Therefore,
                            it is not clear whether they can be grouped together in the same way as the corre­
                            sponding Spanish comparatives are.
                                      However, based on the presence of the relative pronoun nih in sentences
                            such as (279), I conclude that that type of sentence does involve degree relatives
                             like its counterparts in Spanish. This conclusion is supported by the fact that such
                            constructions disallow the types of deletion operations associated with coordinate­
                            like conjunction structures:

                                      Although such sentences share the degree relative structure exhibited in
                             Spanish de comparatives, it is not as straightforward to claim that cah is a preposi­
                             tion in an analogous manner to Spanish de, especially since I wish to liken its func­
                             tion to the coordinator-like function of the conjunction que in Spanish adversative
                             conjunction comparatives. Nevertheless, since I showed earlier in this chapter that
                             the distinction between coordination and subordination is not clear-cut syntactically,
                             it follows that the distinction between elements traditionally classified as coordina­
                             tors and subordinators, respectively, is not clear-cut, either. Witness the fact that al­
                             though I claim Spanish de is a preposition, even in comparatives, it cannot be pied-
                             piped in a question when followed by a degree relative (283)-(286), despite its nor­
                             mal ability to be pied-piped in a question in a non-comparative sentence (287)-
                             (288):

                                      As for comparatives such as (277)-(278) with maazta’, I would ideally like
                             to claim that ta’ and its various allormorphs involve prepositional complementation
                             of an amount or measure phrase, although further research into the nature of ta ’ is
                             needed before making any definitive conclusion. It certainly has not been found to
                             behave as a preposition anywhere else in the language.

                             5.3.3 The particle cah (without subsequent nih)
                                      Comparatives with the comparative particle cah but without a subsequent
                             relative pronoun nih resemble those which do utilize the relative pronoun nih in that
                             they share the same comparative particle. However, since they lack the relative pro­
                             noun nih, and since they obligatorily undergo stripping,961 assume that they involve
                             adversative conjunction structures like the corresponding sentences in Spanish.



                                  08 As mentioned in Chapter 3, SLQZ entirely disallows gapping, in both comparative and
                             non-comparative sentences, so the non-existence of sentences similar to (280) but with two con­
                             trasts instead of just one (i.e., exhibiting gapping instead of comparative ellipsis, which I take to
                             be a type of stripping) sheds no light on the structure of the sentence in (280).




                                                                              315

                                     Lastly, I turn to comparatives with the particle lohoh.97 As mentioned in
                             Chapter 2, this word, which literally means ‘face’, also serves as a native SLQZ
                             preposition. Like other prepositions in SLQZ, if its object is questioned (or moved
                             in some other type of A’-movement such as relativization), it must either be fronted
                             together with its object, as in (290), or remain in situ with the anaphoric possessive
                             clitic pronoun -ni’ (291):
                             (289) B-cwa:a:a’ Jwaany pelo’t loh Rrodriiegw.

                                     Just as in the non-comparative usage of lohoh, the comparative particle
                             lohoh may also front with its object (293):

                            parative lohoh is a preposition but does not take a covert clause (cf. adversative
                             SLQZ cah or Spanish que) nor a degree relative (cf. prepositional SLQZ cah or
                             Spanish de) as its complement, but rather, is parallel to the type of English con­
                            struction seen in the Introduction and exemplified again here:
                            (295)    Juan is tall compared to Pedro.
                            (296)    Juan is tall in comparison with Pedro.
                            (297)    Juan is tall compared with Pedro.
                            (298)    Juan is tall relative to Pedro.
                                     The exact structure involved here is not clear but appears not to involve any
                            element representing degree in the prepositional phrase. I leave to future re-
                            searchthe question of why the SLQZ comparative sentences with lohoh as the com­
                            parative particle contain the morpheme -ru’ ‘ER’, whereas the English sentences in
                            (295)-(298) do not contain ER.

                            6.0 General Statement of Contributions
                                     In this dissertation, I have studied comparative constructions in English,
                            Spanish, San Lucas Quiavinf Zapotec. This dissertation makes descriptive and the­
                            oretical contributions based on review of a wide variety of literature, data collection,
                            and creative analysis and synthesis.

                            6.1 Descriptive Contributions
                                     I provide a new terminology for describing comparatives, various
                            paradigms relevant to the study of comparatives, and various types of new data in
                            •SLQZ both in comparatives and in other contexts.

                            6.1.1 New terminology
                                     In Chapter 3 ,1 provide a new terminology for comparative constructions
                            and synthesized my own terminology for comparative constructions. This termi­
                            nology applies to comparisons whether the terms of comparison are nominals (1),
                            adverbs (2), prepositional phrases (3), or even clauses (4):
                            (1)      Guillermo is taller than Pedro.
                            (2)      The Johnsons bought more books today than yesterday.
                            (3)      Elsa spends more time in France than in England.
                            (4)      Some people dance less elegantly when they are tired than when they are
                                             energetic.
                                     In (1), we know something about Guillermo based on information that we
                            have about Pedro. In (2), we know something about what happened today based
                            on something that happened yesterday. In (3), we know something about what
                            happens in France based on something that happens in England. Finally, in (4), we
                            learn about what happens when people are tired in terms of what happens when
                            they are energetic.
                                     Other terminologies often only allow discussion of the type of comparison




                                                                          318

                            in (1). For example, Stassen (1985) refers to a Comparee NP and a Standard NP,
                            terms which are only applicable in (1).
                                     My use of the word TERM to include not only comparisons with a single
                            contrast in each associate but also those with more than one is helpful in discussing
                            constructions such as comparative gapping (5) and comparative pseudogapping (6).
                                     In (5), the first term consists of the contrasts Rodolfo and con su mama,
                            and the second term consists of the contrasts Trinidad and con sus hermanos:
                            (5)      Rodolfo      pasa      menos         tiempo con      su mamd que
                                     Rodolfo spend.3sg ER.NEG.MUCH time with 3poss mom that
                                            Trinidad con su-s hermanos.
                                            Trinidad with 3poss-pl brothers
                                     ‘Rodolfo spends less time with his mom than Trinidad (does) with his
                                            brothers’
                                     Similarly, in (6), the first term consists of the contrasts Suzie and in the
                            winter, whereas the second term consists of the contrasts Frankie and in the sum­
                            mer.

                            (6)     Suzie plays volleyball more often in the winter than Frankie does in the
                                            summer.
                                     My terminology can also suit various types of compared properties and their
                            syntactic manifestations (the head), such as amount of a nominal KIND (7), degree
                            of an adjective (8), degree of an adverb (9), or extent of a verb (10):
                            (7)     Graciela wrote more articles than she really needed to.
                            (8)     Lorena is smarter than the average bear.
                            (9)     Last Tuesday, Todd behaved more bravely than ever before.
                            (10)    We work more than we should.
                                     In contrast, other works often deal with only adjectival degree comparisons
                            or with only amount comparisons.
                                     An important clarification that I made was that comparisons in which the de­
                            gree to which two terms hold the compared property is represented syntactically,
                            i.e., differential comparative constructions, need to be differentiated from compar-




                                                                         319

                             isons in which this degree is not represented syntactically. For example, the word
                             much in the following comparison does not necessarily imply that in non-compara­
                             tive contexts, the adjectival system allows for a QP slot:
                             (11)        Yolanda is much taller than Ruby.

                             6.1.2       Paradigms
                                        I assembled paradigms of degree adverbials, paradigms of comparative par­
                             ticles, and paradigms of ellipsis type availability, for English, Spanish, and SLQZ.

                             6.1.2.1 Degree paradigms
                                        In Table 6.1, we see a paradigm of English degree expressions alongside
                             the corresponding Spanish degree expressions:1

                             6.1.2.2 Paradigms of comparative particles
                                      Whereas English uses only the comparative particle than in comparisons of
                             inequality, Spanish uses either de or que, and SLQZ uses cah, lohoh, or ta’:
                             Table 6.4 Com parative particles
                             Tvpe of comparison                            English    Spanish           SLQZ
                             based on element following1

                             b) no overt verb or tense,’ partial comparison than      que               cah

                             c) noun phrase in subset comparison           than       que               N/A

                             d) numeral or measure phrase alone            than       de                -ta’

                             f) verb in comparative clause is              than       de lo que,        cah nih

                             altogether different from main verb                      decuanto               ...noun

                                      I exemplify the use of Spanish and SLQZ particles below:
                            Spanish
                            Type (a)
                            (III-180a)         Julia      canta       mejor          que     yo.
                                               Julia sing.pres.3sg well.ER           that lsg.nom
                                               ‘Julia sings better than me’
                             Type (b)
                             (III-181b)        Alfredo comprd              mds        manzanas
                                               Alfredo buy.pret.3sg ER.MUCH.f.pl        apples
                                                      que Ignacia naranjas.
                                                      that Ignacia oranges
                                               ‘Alfredo bought more apples than Ignacia, oranges’



                                  2 This is a simplification. There is a construction with que as the comparative particle in
                             which the second head of the comparison is preposed, even if it is a verb. Cf. §3.4.1.1.3 forade-
                             scriptive of that construction.




                                                                           322

                             6.1.2.3 Paradigms of ellipsis type availability
                                      In Chapter 3 ,1 also present the different types of ellipsis that occur in com­
                             parative constructions, using both terms from the literature as well as new terms
                             (e.g., subset comparatives). I indicate which types are ellipsis in which of the lan­
                             guages under study here and exemplified them. The following table characterizes
                             the various ellipsis types and indicates which of the languages under study permit
                             which ellipsis types:

                                     This raising is probably linked to other cases in SLQZ of elements raising to
                            clause-initial position by Spellout in SLQZ that would remain in situ until LF in lan­
                            guages like English and Spanish, such as quantifiers. Although I do not offer a rig­
                            orous theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, it is an interesting empirical ob­
                            servation and calls attention to an area of needed research.

                            6.2 Theoretical Contributions
                            6.2.1 ER and other Deg’s: morphology, semantics, and syntax
                                     In Chapter 4 ,1 claimed that amount comparisons are merely a special case
                            of adjectival degree comparisons - the relevant adjective in amount comparisons is
                            the abstract quantifier MUCH contained within expressions such as much and
                            many in English, mucho in Spanish, and zye:einy and zi:i’lly in SLQZ. Verbal ex­
                            tent comparisons also involve the abstract quantifier MUCH. To my knowledge,
                            unifying amount comparisons and degree comparisons is a novel idea
                                     I supported my unification of amount comparisons and adjectival compar­
                            isons by exploring the identity of ER vis-a-vis other Deg’s and degree expressions
                            in the context of the nominal system and the adjectival system, as shown above in
                             §6.1.2.1. In the process, I reviewed the literature and synthesized my own conclu­
                            sion that the adjectival system does not ordinarily contain a QP projection, the only




                                                                         334

                             exceptions being certain special adjectives which either are inherently comparative,
                             such as different and alike, or allow modification by a measure phrase, such as tall
                             or old.
                                       I was able to support my claim that the adjectival system generally lacks a
                             QP projection that the nominal system has by analyzing paradigms of degree ex­
                             pressions and finding systematic differences between the two systems.
                                       English nominal expressions are usually immediately preceded by the word
                             much or the word many if they are preceded by a Deg such as very, too, etc.
                             English adjectives are usually not preceded by much when they are preceded by a
                             Deg.
                                       Spanish nominal expressions are not preceded by the word mucho (which I
                             show is a Deg) if there is another Deg present - instead, the Deg surfaces with
                             number and gender agreement, revealing the presence of covert MUCH. When a
                             Deg precedes a Spanish adjective, however, the Deg shows no number or gender
                             agreement, and hence, MUCH is not present.
                                       SLQZ nominal expressions are preceded by the word zye:einy or zid’lly
                             suffixed by a bound Deg or are preceded by a noun-bound Deg which is suffixed
                             by -dya’ or tya’. Non-exceptional SLQZ adjectives, in contrast, are either suffixed
                             directly by a bound Deg or preceded by a non-bound Deg, never with the interven­
                             tion of MUCH (in the form of zye:einy,zi:i’lly, or -dya'/-tya’) .
                                       The comparative degree ER is expressed as the suffix -ru’ in SLQZ, and it
                             is the fact that it shows up suffixed to zye:einy or zi:i’lly that lends further credibili­
                             ty to the proposal made by some in one shape or form (e.g., Bresnan (1973)) that
                             English more is made up of MUCH plus ER The fact that neither zye:einy nor
                             zi:i’lly shows up suffixed by -ru’ in an adjectival comparison lends support to my
                             claim that there are two instances of more in English and mds in Spanish, since one
                             instance of each corresponds to SLQZ zyeteinyru’ or zi:i’llyru’ and the other corre­
                             sponds simply to SLQZ -ru’.




                                                                          335

                                      An extension of the existence of two instances of more in English and mds
                             in Spanish is the conclusion that there must be two instances of less in English and
                             two instances of menos in Spanish. The instance of less and menos that is used in
                             adjectival comparisons contains only ER and some negative element NEG, whereas
                             the instance of each used in nominal comparisons contains not only ER and NEG
                             but also MUCH (plus agreement morphemes).

                             6.2.2 Syntax of the second associate
                                      In Chapter 5 ,1 claimed that the syntactic differences between various types
                             of second associates in comparative constructions cannot be reduced to a difference
                             between coordination and subordination since coordination and subordination are
                             not reliably distinguishable on syntactic criteria I designated them merely extremes
                             in the spectrum of types of conjunction constructions.
                                      I claimed that de comparatives and que comparatives do not underlying have
                             the same structure. Instead, I claimed that de comparatives are prepositional com­
                             plements to ER, containing either a simple amount or measure phrase standard of
                             comparison or a degree relative denoting the standard of comparison. Que compar­
                             atives, on the other hand, involve adversative conjunction, of the same type surfac­
                             ing in many world languages. SLQZ’s comparative particle cah behaves as a prepo­
                             sitional-like element in a construction parallel to the degree relatives in Spanish, but
                             it behaves more like a coordinator-type element in a construction parallel to bare
                             clause comparatives in Spanish. It would convenient if one could claim that the
                             comparative particle ta’ is a preposition since its analog in Spanish is de, but ta’
                             does not function as a preposition anywhere (else) in the English.
                                      Lastly, lohoh is a preposition whose complement is syntactically less com­
                             plex than degree relatives or bare clause comparatives. I conclude this since prepo­
                             sitional phrases headed by lohoh can undergo raising in the same way as other
                             prepositional phrases can in SLQZ. This is in contrast to the behavior of the prepo-




                                                                          336

                             sition de in Spanish, which can ordinarily behave as other prepositions but cannot
                             when it functions as a comparative particle.

                             6.3 Conclusion
                                     A wide variety of comparative construcions and funcitonal morphemes in­
                             volved in both comparatives and other degree expressions that might seem unrelated
                             on the surface can actually be classified into a smaller sets of constructions and
                            morphemes, respectively. English, Spanish, and SLQZ comparative constructions
                            are complex, but the analysis contained in this dissertation is an important step in
                             understanding them and provides a direction for areas of related future research.
