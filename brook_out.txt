ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

 

 
 

I owe my sincere gratitude for all the language consultants who generously shared both their 

time and language with me.  I owe special thanks to Roberto Antonio Ruiz (Tlacolula de 

Matamoros Zapotec; TMZ), Felipe H. Lopez (San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec; SLQZ), and 

Catherine Willomond (Chickasaw).  In addition I want to thank Fantino Aquino (Santa Ana del 

Valle Zapotec), Rodrigo Garcia (SLQZ), Florentino Jimenez (TMZ), Cecilia Lopez (San Juan 

Guelavía Zapotec), Silvia Lopez (SLQZ), and Victoria Lopez (SLQZ), Eloise Pickens 

(Chickasaw).   

 

Silvia Lopez's assistance was integral in planning and implementing the child language 

project.   I sincerely thank her and the Lopez family for their hospitality and for welcoming me 

into their home. 

 

I owe a special thanks to Xóchitl M. Flores-Marcial and her family for sharing their home in 

Tlacolula and for their friendship and support on both sides of the border.  I'm very lucky to have 

met Xochitl and her family. 

 

Thanks for the following people for helping me with Spanish translations at various points 

throughout my work: Heriberto Avelino, Michael Galant, Xóchitl M. Flores-Marcial, Olivia 

Martinez, Pamela Munro, and Aaron Sonnenschein. 

 

Thanks to Melissa Bowerman for graciously sending me a copy of both the Picture Series for 

Positional Verbs (Ameka et al. 1999) and Melissa Bowerman's Topological Relations Picture 

Series (Bowerman [n.d.]).  These have been wonderful stimuli and my work has benefited from 

having them.   

x 

 

Thanks to Thomas Smith Stark for sharing his electronic version of the Córdova vocabulary.  

This electronic (and searchable) vocabulary has been very helpful in working on the Colonial 

documents. 

 

I want to thank the following people for listening to and commenting on the development of 

this work: Christopher Adam, George Aaron Broadwell, Susie Curtiss, John Foreman, Michael 

Galant, Nina Hyams, Eric Jackson, Marcus Kracht, Olivia Martinez, Pamela Munro, Natalie 

Operstein, Carson Schütze, Shabnam Shademan, Marcus Smith, Aaron Sonnenschein, Tim 

Stowell, Kyle Kwanberg, and audiences at COOL 2004, SSILA 2004, SSILA 2005, WAIL 2003, 

and UCLA's American Indian Seminar and Syntax and Semantics Seminar. 

 

I've been fortunate to have many colleagues join me in my fieldwork.  Thank you to George 

Aaron Broadwell, Christina Esposito, John Foreman, and Pamela Munro for joining me in 

working on Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec and for lending me your ears and your thoughts.  I 

also want to thank Kristine Jensen de López, who sent me audio recordings of some elicitation 

work she had done in Tlacolula.  Thank you for thinking of me and sharing these materials.  I'm 

always interested in any materials on Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec. 

 

I've also been lucky to have on occasion been invited to join others in hearing the Zapotec 

language variety they have been working on.  Thank to Christopher Adam, John Foreman, 

Michael Galant, Olivia Martinez, and of course Pamela Munro and their wonderful consultants 

for letting me stop by to hear and appreciate the diversity of Zapotec.   

I owe sincere thanks to the members of my committee: Carson Schütze, Tim Stowell, and 

Kevin Terraciano.  Thank you all for your comments and encouragement.  And although it does 

not seem nearly enough, I offer a special thanks to my committee chair, Pamela Munro, for all of 

her support and encouragement on this project.  I'm very lucky to have such a wonderful 

xi 

 

committee chair.  Pam introduced me to the beautiful language of Zapotec and to the adventure 

of fieldwork.  I've enjoyed being her student, learning from her, and traveling with her.  All 

errors are, or course, my own. 

Finally I owe a huge thanks to my family for their support.  First of all I thank my husband 

Roger Standridge for his support me throughout graduate school and especially for his 

encouragement while writing this dissertation.  In addition I owe a special thanks to Scherion 

Lillehaugen, Lyle Lillehaugen, Trent Lillehaugen, and Dominika Lillehaugen for all their 

support.  And a special thanks to little Daniella who joined our family in the middle of graduate 

school and who made breaks from dissertation writing more enjoyable. 

This research was partially funded by the UCLA Department of Linguistics (1999-2005), a 

Dissertation Year Fellowship from UCLA (2004-2005), a Research Grant from the Institute of 

American Cultures through the Chicano Studies Research Center at UCLA (2003), a Summer 

Research Mentorship Fellowship from UCLA (2003), a Travel Grant from the UCLA Latin 

American Studies Center (2001) and Summer Research Grants from the Linguistics Department 

at UCLA (1999 and 2001).

ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION 

 
 
 

Expressing Location in Tlacolula Valley Zapotec 

 
 

by 

 
 

Brook Danielle Lillehaugen 

 

Doctor of Philosophy in Linguistics 

 

University of California, Los Angeles, 2006 

 

Professor Pamela Munro, Chair 

 
 
 

This dissertation examines how location is expressed linguistically in Tlacolula Valley Zapotec 

(TVZ), discussing syntactic and semantic issues specifically related to  component part 

prepositions (CPP) and positional verbs. 

  Chapter 1 provides background on the language sources, my research methodology, a brief 

grammatical sketch of Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec, and an introduction to topics relevant to 

the expression of location.   

 

In Chapter 2 I look closely at CPPs and how they function in TVZ grammar, describing their 

syntactic behavior and arguing that they should be classified as prepositions.   

  Chapter 3 examines the meaning and use of the CPPs in a wide range of locative and non-

locative constructions.  I show that an important part of the meaning of a CPP is the range of 

frames of reference it allows and that Grounds can constrain the types of frames of reference that 

can be used with them.  Data from Zapotec child language acquisition shows that children can 

acquire the meaning of CPPs independently of referential component parts.  Finally, I propose 

xv 

 

possible paths of language change to account for the synchronic behavior of component part 

prepositions.   

  Chapter 4 provides typological evidence showing that the syntactic realization (preposition or 

relational noun) of a component part locative is not predictable from its meaning, nor is the type 

meaning predictable  from its syntactic realization. 

 

Finally, in Chapter 5 I analyze the system of positional verbs in TVZ, describing their 

syntactic and semantic behavior.

1. 

Preliminaries 

In this chapter I provide relevant background information.  In §1.1 I provide information about 

the language sources used in this dissertation.  My research methodology is described in §1.2.  I 

present a grammatical sketch of Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec in §1.3.  §1.4 provides a 

foundation for further discussion on the expression of location linguistically. 

 

1.1.  Languages and data sources 

 

My research is based on primary data from Tlacolula Valley Zapotec languages. For comparison 

I bring in data from other Zapotec languages, Colonial Valley Zapotec, and Chickasaw, a 

Muskogean language. These data sources are described in more detail in the following sections.   

Zapotec languages belong to the Otomanguean stock and are spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico, and 

by many immigrants in the greater Los Angeles area.  This dissertation presents data from the 

several Zapotec language groups: Tlacolula Valley Zapotec (§1.1.1), other Valley and Central 

Zapotec language varieties (§1.1.2), Northern Zapotec (§1.1.3), and Southern Zapotec (§1.1.4).  

Providing examples from other Zapotec languages where possible and appropriate is beneficial 

for several reasons.  First of all it allows me to make comparative analysis, which is important 

for issues related to language change.  Secondly, as Zapotec languages are under-described, and 

my own work on Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec is far from comprehensive, having access to 

data from other Zapotec varieties is useful in filling in potential data gaps.  While of course such 

gaps are best filled by more work on the language variety in question, comparative data can give 

us an idea of the bigger picture in the mean time. 

 

For all Zapotec language varieties, I provide the Ethnologue code (Gordon 2005) and the 

classification of the language according to Smith Stark (2003).  (Smith Stark's classification of 

the Zapotec languages is the most recent classification, but not the only one.  I refer readers 

interested in other classifications to the primary sources: Radin (1925), Angulo (1925, 1926), 

Angulo and Freeland (1935), Swadesh (1947), Fernández de Miranda (1965), Rendón (1967, 

1975), Suárez (1973), and Kaufman (1989, 1994).  Smith Stark (2003) provides a good summary 

of these previous classifications as well as others.  

 

Table 1 below gives a visual overview of the organization of the various Zapotec varieties 

cited in this dissertation.

In addition to providing data from several modern Zapotec varieties, I also provide data from 

 

Colonial Valley Zapotec (§1.1.5). 

Finally, in §1.1.6 I describe the sources for the data I present on the Muskogean language 

Chickasaw.

1.1.1.  Tlacolula Valley Zapotec 

My dissertation is primarily based on data from Tlacolula Valley Zapotec (TVZ) language 

varieties, which belong to the Valley Zapotec group (zapoteco del valle occidental (Smith Stark 

2003:43)), which in turn belongs to the larger Central Zapotec group (Smith Stark 2003:41). The 

language group I refer to as TVZ contains the languages classified by the Ethnologue (Gordon 

2005) as San Juan Guelavía Zapotec (Western Tlacolula Zapotec, Guelavía Zapotec, code ZAB).  

However, since San Juan Guelavía Zapotec is also the name of one of the speech varieties within 

TVZ, in order to prevent confusion I do not use this name to refer to the group of language 

varieties.  Instead, I use the name Tlacolula Valley Zapotec to refer to the Ethnologue's ZAB 

group.  The TVZ language varieties are classified by Smith Stark (2003:45) as follows (where 

>> indicates a subgroup): zapoteco central >> zapoteco del valle occidental >> zapoteco de 

Tlacolula occidental. 

The TVZ language varieties for which data are presented in this dissertation are Tlacolula de 

Matamoros Zapotec (TMZ), San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec (SLQZ), San Juan Guelavía Zapotec 

(SJGZ), and San Marcos Tlapazola Zapotec (SMTZ).  These language varieties are spoken in the 

Tlacolula Valley, which is located approximately 30 km to the southeast of Oaxaca City. Oaxaca 

City (labeled Oaxaca) can be located roughly south of Mexico City in Figure 1; the Tlacolula 

Valley is presented in Figure 2.

I don't know of any other published work on Tlacolula de Matamoros Zapotec (TMZ) except 

for my own and my joint work with Pamela Munro.  TMZ is spoken in Tlacolula de Matamoros, 

which can be found near the center of Figure 2.  I began my fieldwork on this language in 1999 

with Pamela Munro and all of the data from TMZ come from my fieldwork.  Most of the 

examples that I cite in my dissertation are followed by one of two types of references.  A 

numeric reference, such as (4:233) is a reference to field notes.  (The first number represents the 

number of the book and the second number the page number.)  A reference such as (Zhat:12) is a 

reference to an oral narrative.  (Before the colon is an abbreviation of the name of the story; 

"Zhat" is an abbreviation of: Zh:àa't, Cu'nùu' Zh:àa't? 'Toad, Where are You, Toad?'  After the 

colon is a reference to the line number in the transcription of the story.)  These references are 

primarily for my own use, but they may be of interest to other researchers, as most of the 

narratives are currently available the Archive for Indigenous Languages of Latin America 

(AILLA; www.ailla.utexas.org), as both audio files and analyzed transcriptions.  Eventually all 

of the narratives referenced in this dissertation will be made available at AILLA, where the 

analyzed transcriotions will be updated and corrected.  I am also archiving my field notebooks at 

AILLA, and many are already available.  A list of the narratives cited in this dissertation is

below in Table 2, along with the abbreviations used to reference them at AILLA.  Zhat is also 

included in the dissertation as Appendix I, although the archived version at AILLA may be more 

up-to-date.

In addition to the narratives, many of the example sentences in chapters 2 and 5 of this 

dissertation are available as audio files at AILLA, records ZAB005R006 - ZAB005R009. 

I have previously written about TMZ in my master's thesis (Lillehaugen 2003), other papers 

(Lillehaugen 2004a, 2004c), and conference presentations (Lillehaugen 2004b, 2004d, 2005a, 

2005b, 2006, Lillehaugen and Munro 2006).    

SLQZ has been described by Pamela Munro and Felipe Lopez and their colleagues in a 

dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999), an unpublished revision of the same dictionary 

(Munro and Lopez in prep.), dissertations by Felicia Lee (1999) and Michael Galant (1998), and 

a thesis by Olivia Méndez [Martínez] (2000), as well as a plethora of articles by Munro (e.g. 

Munro 1996, 2002, 2005a, 2005b, 2006b).  Currently, Munro, Lopez, and I are co-authoring a 

first-year Zapotec language textbook (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.) which has been 

used to teach Zapotec at University of California, San Diego for the past two years (2004-2005 

and 2005-2006), and is planned to be used again this coming year (2006-2007).   

SLQZ data that are not otherwise credited comes from  my unpublished field notes on this 

language, based on joint fieldwork with Pamela Munro, which may be followed by a numeric 

reference to my field notes as described above for TMZ.  Much of the cited SLQZ data are from 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999 and Munro and Lopez, in prep.   References to these in examples 

will be abbreviated as "ML" and "ML in prep.".  Data taken from Cali Chiu (Munro, 

Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.) are marked with the abbreviation "CC" in examples. 

The New Testament has been translated into SJGZ (Liga Bíblica 1995).  Ted Jones and his 

colleagues have written on its phonology (Jones and Knudson 1977) and pronoun system (Jones 

 
 

7 

and Church 1985).  Olivia Martínez has done fieldwork on this language (Martínez, in progress).  

All of the SJGZ data in this thesis come from Martínez's, Munro's, and my unpublished field 

notes.   

The work on San Marcos Tlapazola Zapotec (SMTZ) that I am aware of is by Kristine Jensen 

de López, who has studied the acquisition of  San Marcos Tlapazola Zapotec (Jensen de López 

1999, 2002, 2005), specifically the acquisition of locatives.  All of the SMTZ data cited are from 

Jensen de López's work. 

TVZ language varieties should all be considered endangered since they are losing speakers 

faster than they are gaining them.  Of the four varieties presented here, TMZ seems the most 

critically endangered: there are most likely no more than a few hundred speakers of TMZ, and to 

my knowledge, the youngest speakers are in their 50s.  There are no children acquiring TMZ, 

though at the time I am writing this there are still children acquiring SLQZ and SMTZ. 

 

1.1.2.  Other Central Zapotec languages 

I provide data from two other Central Zapotec varieties: Ayoquesco Zapotec and Mitla Zapotec. 

The data sources for these languages are discussed below. 

Ayoquesco Zapotec (Ethnologue code ZAF, also known as Western Ejutla Zapotec, 

Zapoteco de Santa María Ayoquesco (Gordon 2005)) is spoken in "the southern extreme of the 

Valley of Oaxaca" (MacLaury 1989:119).  The Ethnologue states that it is closest to Ocotlán 

Zapotec (Ethnologue code ZAC) (Gordon 2005) and Smith Stark (2003:42) classifies it as 

zapoteco central >> zapoteco de Ejutla occidental.  There is a lexicon for this language 

(MacLaury 1970).  All of the Ayoquesco Zapotec data cited in this dissertation come from 

MacLaury (1989). 

Mitla Zapotec (MZ) is categorized in the Ethnologue as Mitla Zapotec, with the alternate 

names of East Central Tlacolula Zapotec, East Valley Zapotec, and Didxsaj, code ZAW (Gordon 

2005).  MZ is a Valley Zapotec language,  closely related to the TVZ language group; Smith 

Stark (2003:46) classifies it as zapoteco central >> zapoteco de Mitla.  It is spoken in San Pablo 

Villa de Mitla, which can be located on the far right of the map in Figure 2.  There is a dictionary 

(Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991),  a grammar (Briggs 1961), and a collection of texts 

(Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1994) for Mitla Zapotec.  Although I have had the opportunity to 

 
 

8 

hear MZ for a few hours, I have not done significant fieldwork worked on this language.  All of 

the MZ data in this dissertation come from the Stubblefield sources. 

 

1.1.3.  Northern Zapotec 

I cite data from one Northern Zapotec languages (classified as zapoteco de la sierra norte by 

Smith Stark (2003:48)): San Bartolomé Zoogocho Zapotec (Ethnologue  code ZPQ; zapoteco de 

la sierra norte >> cajono >> zapoteco de Zoogocho (Smith Stark 2003:50)).  The data are from 

Sonnenschein (2004a, 2004b, and 2005). 

 

1.1.4.  Southern Zapotec 

I also cite data and / or analysis from two Southern Zapotec languages (classified as zapoteco de 

la sierra sur by Smith Stark (2003:37)): Coatlán-Loxicha Zapotec (Ethnologue code ZPS 

(Gordon 2005), zapoteco de la sierra sur >> coateco extendido >> coateco (Smith Stark 

2003:38)) and Coatecas Altas Zapotec  (Ethnologue ZCA (Gordon 2005)), zapoteco de la sierra 

sur >> coateco extendido (Smith Stark 2003:37).  The Coatlán-Loxicha Zapotec data are from 

Beam de Azcona (2004 and in prep.) and the Coatecas Altas Zapotec data cited come from 

Benton (in prep.). 

 

1.1.5.  Colonial Valley Zapotec 

I also present data from Colonial Valley Zapotec (CVZ), which come from documents (mostly 

wills) written in Zapotec by native speakers in Colonial Oaxaca.   Since 1999, Pamela Munro 

and Kevin Terraciano (History, UCLA) have led a group of researchers at UCLA in a long term 

project of translating and analyzing Zapotec language texts from the Spanish Colonial period in 

Mexico. The current contributing  members are Xóchitl Flores-Marcial, Michael Galant, Munro, 

Diana Schwartz, Aaron Sonnenschein, Lisa Sousa, and Terraciano.  Past contributors have 

included Christina Esposito, John Foreman, Felipe H. Lopez, Olivia Martínez, Julie 
Morgenlender, and myself.1  

These documents, collected by Terraciano and Sousa from archives in Mexico, were written 

in Zapotec by native speakers using Roman letters to approximate the language's complicated 

                                                 
1 The group has also benefited from the following visiting participants: Heriberto Avelino, George Aaron 
Broadwell, and Michel Oudijk.

phonological system.  The inaccuracy of the writing system and doubts about the meaning of the 

(inconsistent) spelling conventions make many types of phonological analysis nearly impossible, 

but does allow for some types of morphosyntactic analysis. These documents are also 

accompanied by Spanish translations, which were made at some point later (often significantly 

later) than the time the original documents were written.  For the most part we have found the 

translations to be accurate, although on occasion there have been large sections of Zapotec which 

seem not to have been translated in the Spanish.  On only a few instances have we found what 

we believe to be significant errors in the translation. 

There are several additional Colonial period resources: a grammar and vocabulary written by 

Fr. Juan de Córdova (1578a, 1578b) and the later Junta Columbina vocabulary (1893). These 

tools have been invaluable in analyzing the Colonial documents, despite many problematic 

features. Additionally, there is a modern index to Córdova's vocabulary and the Junta Columbina 

(Whitecotton and Whitecotton 1993).  

 

Figure 4 shows a sample page from a Colonial document.  For each document, a member 

of the research group transcribes and provides a morphological analysis for the Zapotec.  A small 

example of this process is shown below: in Figure 3 you can see one line of Zapotec, for which 

an analysis is given in (1).

At the time I left the group (December 2005), we had analyzed 29 documents.  These 

documents are presented in Table 3 along with their abbreviations, which will be used to refer to 
these documents throughout this dissertation.3 These documents come from eight different 

pueblos and cover 188 years, from 1565 to 1753.  We do not know how many distinct languages 

these documents represented, even in Colonial times.

Table 3. CVZ documents 

The Colonial documents are a rich source of data for the use of body and component part 

terms in CVZ.  Given the nature of the material, however, I can use the documents only to 

provide positive evidence.  Therefore, the lack of an example of a particular meaning of some 

word does not mean the word was not being used in that way at that time.  And, of course, I have 

                                                 
3 Colonial Zapotec references are in this pattern: document.abbreviation -page.number; line.number

no access to CVZ speakers who could judge potential sentences as ungrammatical.  

Nevertheless, the type of information that the positive data provides is useful, and the CVZ data 

add an important dimension to the discussion of expressing location in Tlacolula Valley Zapotec, 

including the semantic range of the component part terms (Chapter 3), possible paths of semantic 

and syntactic change (Chapter 3), and the form and function of positional verbs (presented in 

Chapter 5).   

 

1.1.6.  Beyond Zapotec: Chickasaw 

In addition to data from various Zapotec language varieties, for comparative purposes I also 

present data from the Muskogean language Chickasaw.  Chickasaw is a language primarily 

spoken in Oklahoma.  The fieldwork reported in this dissertation was done in Los Angeles with 

native speaker consultant Mrs. Catherine Willmond.  The data are presented in the practical 

orthography of Munro and Willmond (1994).  Unless otherwise noted, the Chickasaw data come 

from my and Munro's unpublished field notes. 

 

1.2.  Research methodology 

The data presented in this dissertation were gathered in the field both in Los Angeles and 

Oaxaca, Mexico employing several methods.  Traditional elicitation methods based on 

translation tasks were used, where a language consultant was presented with a sentence in 

English or Spanish, and asked to provide the equivalent in Zapotec.  However, I found using this 

translation-style elicitation was often insufficient for doing detailed research on locatives. 

Instead, I often employed a technique where I presented the speaker with a visual array using 

toys,4 as illustrated in the Figures below, and asked the consultant to describe the relationship 

between the objects in the scene.  This allowed me to record as much detail about the scene as 

was potentially relevant.  If a speaker were asked to translate "the woman is in the car", for 

example, it is very probable that both I and the speaker would imagine a locative relationship 

like the one in Figure 5.  

                                                                                                                                                            
where the page and line number indicate the beginning of the quoted passage. 
4 Thanks to Pamela Munro who brought the first set of toys to our meetings!  Her original farm set was 
inspiration for me.

Figure 5.  woman and car 

 

 

However, if I wanted to ask a speaker how to say "the dog is on the car" and I had in mind the 

locative relationship in Figure 6, it would be very unlikely that the speaker would be imagining 

the same scenario.  Since the patterns of component part locatives used in locative relationships 

where the items involved are in non-canonical orientations proved to be very important to this 

research, employing toys to create such scenes was very useful, since explaining such a scene 

using words is difficult to say the least. 

Figure 6.  dog and car 

 

 
  Another benefit of having language consultants describe scenes instead of translating is that I 

could keep track of the direction that all of the entities were facing in relation to each other and 

to the speaker, which also proved to be of interest.  For example, in Figure 7, the man is beside 

the woman, but his body is also facing her, though his face is toward the speaker.  This type of 

information is not available when a speaker is simply asked to translate "the man is beside the 

woman", because there is no way I could know what particular array the speaker is imagining in 

his or her mind.  By using these visual stimuli, I could be certain that the particular locative 

relationship I was interested in was in fact the same scene my consultant was describing.   

 
 

14 

Figure 7.  man and woman 

 

 
 

There was an additional, unexpected benefit of using these visual stimuli.  I believe that 

because of the toys, people were willing to work with me who otherwise might not have been.  

For example, in Tlacolula I visited an elderly couple, and the husband sat down at the table to 

work with me, while the wife sat farther away, observing us.  When I got out the toys and set 

them up and began to work with the husband, she became very interested.  Then, at one point, 

her husband said something that she disagreed with, and she came over to correct him by moving 

the toys until in her opinion they matched what he had said.  After that she became very involved 

in the conversation and I was able to get a lot of judgments from her.   

I have also collected data using stimuli developed at the Max Planck Institute for 

Psycholinguistics at Nijmegen: "PosB", which was designed to elicit data on positional verbs 

(Ameka et al. 1999) and "BowPed" which was designed to elicit data regarding topological 

relations (Bowerman n.d.).  These have been very useful both for gathering linguistic data (e.g. 

discovering the boundaries in the meanings of locatives and positional verbs) and in engaging 

consultants.    

 

1.3.  Grammatical description of TMZ 

In this section I present a brief grammatical description of TMZ.  For a detailed description of 

SLQZ see the wonderful introduction to the SLQZ dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999), 

and for a detailed description of TVZ in general, see Cali Chiu (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez 

in prep.).  In this section, I seek only to describe areas that will be important in understanding the 

rest of the dissertation, and in documenting areas of TMZ grammar that differ significantly from 

SLQZ.  In my future work I hope to document more fully the grammar of this beautiful 

language. 
 
 

15 

The following topics will be introduced in the sections to follow: phoneme inventory and 

orthography (§1.3.1), plural marking (§1.3.2), pronouns (§1.3.3), word order (§1.3.4), non-focus 

làa' (§1.3.5), possession (§1.3.6), demonstratives (§1.3.7), verbs (§1.3.8), and conjunction 

(§1.3.9).  

 

1.3.1.  Phoneme inventory and orthography 

The TVZ data are presented in the orthography developed for SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999); for a detailed discussion of the phonemes and their allophones in SLQZ, please refer to 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999 and for a pedagogical introduction to the sounds in TVZ refer to 

Cali Chiu (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.).  Table 4 summarizes the consonant 

inventory of the TVZ languages.  Sounds that are found only in loan words are in parentheses.  

The sounds in the shaded boxes are found in only some TVZ varieties, as indicated in 

parenthesis after that sound. 

  Most TMZ consonants come in fortis / lenis pairs.  The following description of fortis and 

lenis for SLQZ seems a good characterization for TMZ as well. 

Like  other  Zapotec  languages,  SLQZ  has  a  pervasive  phonological  contrast  between  fortis  and 
lenis  consonants;  most  of  these  occur  in  pairs.    The  terms  "fortis"  and  "lenis"  identify 
phonetically  disparate  groups  of  sounds:  there  seems  to  be  no  single  phonetic  feature  whose 
presence  of  absence  can  identify  all  the  fortis  consonants  or  all  the  lenis  consonants.    The 
distinguishing characteristics of fortis obstruents is articulatory tension; that of fortis sonorants in 
increased duration. 
 
range in most positions from voiced  stops to very lenited voiced fricatives… 

The fortis stops… are voiceless and often aspirated (especially finally)… The lenis stops… 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:1 

 
P, t, and c / qu are fortis stops.  B, d, g / gu are their lenis counterparts.  C is written as qu and 

 

g as gu before the vowels e, ë, and i because of a similar rule in Spanish orthography.  Since 

many Zapotec speakers can read and write Spanish, this orthographic convention is familiar to 

them.  (While there is no letter ë in Spanish orthography, it so closely resembles the Spanish 

letter e that extending this orthographic rule to it seems natural.) 

TMZ has the following fricatives: s (fortis alveolar), z (lenis alveolar), x (fortis alveopalatal), 

zh (lenis alveopalatal), x: (fortis retroflex), zh: (lenis retroflex).  Additionally, borrowed words 

may use f (fortis labio-dental) and j (fortis velar).   

More research is needed on the phonetic inventory and phonological status of affricates in 

TMZ.  My preliminary conclusion is that there are three affricates: ts (fortis alveolar) (2), ch 

 
 

16 

(fortis alveopalatal) (3), and dzh (lenis alveopalatal) (4).  This inventory is asymmetric lacking dz 

(lenis alveolar).  It also includes one more affricate than SLQZ, which does not have dzh, as 

indicated with shading in Table 4.  Examples of these affricates in TMZ are shown below in (2) 

– (4), along with their cognates in SLQZ.  (As mentioned earlier, references to Munro and 

Lopez, et al. 1999 are abbreviated as ML in examples and references to Cali Chiu (Munro, 

Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.) are abbreviated as CC.)

4.  a.  dìi'dzh (TMZ)

b.  dìi'zh (SLQZ; ML:108) 
 
Sonorants also appear in fortis / lenis pairs.  The fortis sonorants are ll, mm, nn, and nng.  The 

corresponding lenis sonorants are l, m, n, ng.  The description below of SLQZ also seems 

accurate for TMZ.  

… fortis sonorants … are generally longer in duration than the corresponding lenis sonorants… 
(for  corresponding  phenomena  in  other  Zapotec  languages,  cf.  Jaeger  1983:190,  Jones  and 
Knudson 1977:166)…  The velar nasals  ng and  nng are usually pronounced as simple lenis and 
fortis nasals, respectively, in final position (where they occur must commonly); in other positions, 
and rarely even finally, the g is clearly pronounced, so perhaps these sounds should be analyzed 
as clusters or prenasalized stops. 
  …Sonorants  of  all  types  are  generally  fully  voiced  in  all  positions,  though  some  fortis 
sonorants, especially ll, may be slightly devoiced following breathy vowels or before final y. 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:2   
 

The pair rr and r look orthographically like a fortis / lenis pair, but this remains an open 

questions, as described in the SLQZ dictionary below. Rr represents a trill and r represents a tap, 

when word initial or word internal, and a trill when word final. 

Rr is a trilled r that appears in Spanish loans or over a morpheme boundary in non-loans, where it 
functions phonologically as a cluster (as suggested for Guelavía Zapotec by Jones and Knudson 
1977:169);  only  the  tap  r  occurs  internal  to  native  morphemes…  Although  the  pair  rr  /  r 
orthographically resemble the fortis / lenis sonorant pairs ll / l, mm / m, and nn / n, we are not yet 
sure of the phonological parallelism suggested by our spelling is correct.

Table 4.  Consonant inventory of Tlacolula Valley Zapotec in orthography 

 
TMZ has six vowel qualities, which are presented in Table 5.  The pronunciation of a, e, i, o, 

and u corresponds with their IPA equivalents.  The sixth vowel, ë, is a high back unrounded 

vowel.  While the vowel qualities seem to be roughly equivalent between SLQZ and TMZ, the 

correspondence of the vowel qualities is an open question.  Impressionistically, ë is much more 

common in TMZ than in SLQZ, and often corresponds to SLQZ e or u.   Note that in SLQZ 

some speakers use ë instead of e for some words. 

In  many  words  Felipe  Lopez  has  e  corresponding  to  Rodrigo  Garcia's  ë.    We  have  not  yet 
investigated the historical consequences of this observation, although impressionistically it seems 
likely that the ë pronunciation is conservative. 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:2 

 
I hope to look at this and other correspondence of vowel qualities between these two varieties in 

the future.

Table 5.  vowel inventory of Tlacolula Valley Zapotec in orthography 

 
While the vowel inventory itself may seem simple, in fact vowels and combinations of 

vowels in TVZ are very complex.  Each TMZ vowel occurs with one of four phonation types: 

modal (plain), breathy, checked, or creaky.  Breathy vowels are written with an h following the 

vowel (ah, eh, ëh, ih, oh, uh).  Checked vowels are written with an apostrophe following the 

vowel (a', e', ë', i', o', u').  Creaky vowels are written with a grave accent over the vowel (à, è, ì, 

ò, ù), except for the vowel ë, for which a circumflex is used (ê).  

Each TVZ word has a "key syllable" which can contain a sequence of such vowels, as 

described for SLQZ below.   

The fullest SLQZ syllable template is CCGVVVCG,  where  C  represents a true consonant,  G a 
glide,  and  V  is  a  vowel,  which  may  (with  certain  restrictions)  have  any  of  the  four  phonation 
types  just  described.    Thus,  for  example,  the  word  barcwiaha'cw  "bird  witch"  ends  with  a 
sequence of rcwiaha'cw which could, on its own, constitute a key syllable representing the fullest 
expansion of this syllable template.  All elements of the template except a single V are optional, 
though  almost  all  syllables  have  a  consonantal  onset  and  the  majority  contain  more  than  one 
vowel.  Most often, only the final syllable of a non-compound uninflected native word (which we 
will  call  the  key  syllable)  is  as  elaborated  as  this  template.    This  key  syllable  generally  is 
perceived as stressed, though we do not have a clear understanding of this phenomenon… 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:3 

 
If the final syllable of a non-compound uninflected word is not the stressed syllable, for example 

in some Spanish loans, an acute accent is used on the first vowel of the syllable which is stressed 

to indicate that it is the key syllable, as in fá'sihlly 'easy, easily' (SLQZ; Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999:3).   

Each vowel complex (i.e. sequence of vowels within a syllable) has a tone pattern, e.g. high, 

low, falling, and rising.  This tone is predictable from the sequence of phonation types, as 

described for SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et al.).  In SLQZ twenty-seven different combinations of 

vowel phonations can occur in a vowel complex in the key syllable of a word (Munro 2005a).  

These patterns are shown in Table 6. 

 
 

19 

It is also possible for vowels of different qualities to appear together in one vowel complex.  

However, all logic possibilities are not possible.  The vowels that can occur together in a vowel 

complex are diphthongs.  Below is the description of diphthongs in SLQZ. 

A two- or three-vowel sequence generally contains only one vowel quality or reflects one of the 
standard  SLQZ  diphthongs,  ai,  au,  ei,  eu,  ia,  iu,  ua,  ue,  and  (for  some  speakers)  ëa;  a  few 
additional diphthongs appear in Spanish loans, and the rare additional diphthong ëa occurs in one 
word.   

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:3 

 
TMZ also has diphthongs, the inventory of which will be part of my future work on this 

language.  There do, however, seem to be some differences in the diphthong inventory between 

TMZ and SLQZ which you may notice in the data cited in this dissertation.

Table 6. SLQZ vowel complexes and associated tones (Table 2 from Munro 2005a) 

 

 
 

20 

 

Some vowels are very strongly nasalized in TMZ, for example the a in Pa'anfy 'Panfila'.  In 

fact, in some cases I do not hear the n at all and only hear a very strongly nasalized a, something 

more like Pã'ãfy, where ˜ indicates nasalization.  There are not very many words like this, and in 

all but one case there is a nasal consonant adjacent to the word.  For now I am not considering 

nasalization to be phonemic, and am assuming some conditioning environment can be found, so I 

will not indicate nasalization in the orthography.  The only word that remains a real question for 

me under this working hypothesis is the word for 'yes' which I might write as õhõh.  This word 

always sounds very nasalized to me, and I have never heard a final n.  This remains an 

unresolved problem. 

The spelling of some TMZ words has been changed from that my previous work (e.g. 

Lillehaugen 2003).  In these cases, the updated spelling reflects my current belief about the 

phonemes in these words.  

This description of the sounds of TMZ is very brief and certainly inadequate for the reader to 

imagine the sounds of this beautiful language.  Some audio recordings of TMZ are available 

publicly at the AILLA archive (www.ailla.utexas.org).  A search for "Tlacolula de Matamoros 

Zapotec" will return everything archived on this language.  Some items are password protected, 

but other are available to listen to freely to the public, currently including a frog story (Zh:àa't, 

Cu'nùu', Zh:àa't? record #ZAB001R001) and a speaker counting from one to twenty (record 

#ZAB002R001).  

 

1.3.2.  Plural marking 

Plural nouns are optionally marked with the plural marker da in TMZ.  The SLQZ plural marker 
ra5 is identified in the dictionary as a plural proclitic (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:206).  I 

believe the same is probably true of the plural marker da in TMZ. 

 

In context, certain nouns not marked with da can be interpreted as plural (5a), and a noun 

marked with da always receives a plural interpretation (5b). 

                                                 
5 Note that while da and ra seem to suggest a correspondence between d and r in TMZ and SLQZ, this is 
not usually the case.  For example, the word for 'all' is raa in both TMZ and SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et 
al. 1999:207).

There seems to be some semantic differences among these, but more work is needed to 

determine the nature of this difference, which may be in e.g. definiteness or specificity.   

 

1.3.3.  Pronouns 

The pronoun systems found in  TVZ languages are rather complex (Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999:14, Munro 2002), with many different types of pronouns and different types of distinctions.  

Consider the following description of the pronouns in SLQZ. 

Zapotec has several different types of independent (non-clitic) pronouns: ordinary pronouns (used 
for emphatic subjects, for ordinary subjects of verbless predicate nominal sentences, for objects, 
and  as  pronominal  predicates),  nominal  pronouns  (third  person  pronouns  used  only  as  clause-
initial subjects or focused objects), and demonstrative pronouns (third person demonstratives that 
can be used in  any sentence role or position).   In addition there is a relative pronoun,  nih, and 
interrogative pronouns. 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:23

In this section I will present the outline of the pronominal system in TMZ focusing on the 

ordinary free (or independent) pronouns and clitic pronouns.  By doing this, I leave many 

relevant issues open for future investigation. For a detailed discussion on the types and uses of 

pronouns in SLQZ see Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999 (e.g. 14-16,  23-24).   

 

In Table 7 I present the forms of both the free and clitic pronouns in TMZ and in the 

following sections I discuss the morphology and meaning of the first person (§1.3.3.1), second 

person (§1.3.3.2), and third person (§1.3.3.3) pronouns in turn.  Throughout this discussion, I 

will contrast the TMZ pronouns in form and meaning with SLQZ. 

 

The particular distinctions made in the pronouns depend on the person.  For example, for the 

first person, the only (clear) distinctions made are in number.  For the second person there are 

distinctions in both number and formality.  For the third person there are distinctions in number 

and "hierarchy".  These third person distinctions in hierarchy are very complex, and I can only 

offer a basic description here.  For more detailed discussion of such distinctions in SLQZ see 

Munro 2002. 
  As in SLQZ,6 pronominal subjects, possessors, and objects of native prepositions are realized 

as clitic pronouns.  Verbal pronominal objects, focused or topic pronominal subjects, and objects 

of borrowed prepositions are realized with free pronouns.  As Munro and Lopez, et al. point out, 

the free pronouns are formed of a base plus the clitic pronouns (1999:14, 23).  The most common 

base is làa' which is used for all third person and for some second persons; the other bases are 

discussed in the relevant sections below. 

                                                 
6 Munro and Lopez, et al. (1999) describe the use of clitic pronouns and independent pronouns in SLQZ 
as follows. 

In  theory,  Habitual  verbs  inflected  for  subject  are  derived  from  the  listed  unsuffixed  r-stem  by 
adding  one  of  the  18  pronominal  subject  clitics…  The  same  clitics  are  also  used  to  express 
nominal possessors and one type of prepositional object [i.e. of a native preposition]…   
 
Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:14 

 

 

 
These  [independent  pronouns]  have  five  main  uses:  they  may  indicate  verbal  objects…  and 
objects of the second type of preposition described in section 4.33 below [Spanish prepositions], 
they  may  function  as  pronominal  predicates,  they  may  be  used  as  the  subjects  of  verbless 
predicate nominal sentences…, and they  may be used emphatically (for instance, a verb  whose 
subject  is  indicated  by  a  pronominal  clitic  may  also  have  an  optional  preceding  independent 
pronoun subject…

1.3.3.1.  First person pronouns 

Table 7.  pronouns in TMZ 

The most common form for the first person singular free pronoun in TMZ is narèe' (7a), which 

seems to consist of a (phonologically reduced) shorter first person singular free pronoun nàa' 

(7b) and the demonstrative rèe' 'here' (cf. §1.3.7).  My main consultant will accept nàa' as a first 

person free pronoun, and will happily repeat sentences I created using it, but he does not 

volunteer it.  Note that the first person singular free pronoun in SLQZ nàa' (Munro and Lopez, et 

al. 1999:173) looks like the shorter form in TMZ; the form narèe' is not used in SLQZ. 

7.  a.  na-rèe' (TMZ) 
 

 

1.FP-here 
'I; me' 

 
b.  nàa' (TMZ) 
 
 
 

1.FP 
'I; me' 

The clitic form of the first person singular is =a'.  Note that the shorter free first person singular 

pronoun, nàa' (7b), seems to end in =a'. 

 

TMZ seems to have three forms for the first person plural.  All three forms start with 

dunnùu=; for this reason, I identify it as a first person plural base.  The shortest form is 

dunnùuëhnn 'we; us' (8a), with clitic form =(h)nn (8b).  This form  seems to correspond to the 

form in SLQZ: dannoohnn, dannuahnn 'we; us' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:101), with clitic 

 
 

24 

form =ëhnn (Munro and Lopez in prep.:115).  While the string =ëhnn is found in the TMZ free 

pronoun, which seems to be composed of the base dunnùu= and =ëhnn, I have no other evidence 

that it is ever used as a clitic  pronoun in TMZ.  Attempts to use it are judged as ungrammatical 

(8c).  

8.  a.  dunnùuëhnn (TMZ; 5:158)

b.  R-gwi'ih=nn. (TMZ; 5:170) 

HAB-see=1PL 
'we see' 
 

c.  *x:-yèe'cw=ëhnn (TMZ; 5:158) 

bad with any meaning; e.g. cannot mean 'our dog' 

 
  One longer form (9a) consists of the first person plural base dunnùu=  followed by the plural 

proclitic da (see §1.3.2) and the =(h)nn 'we' pronoun clitic. (This is not unlike the formation of 

third person plural clitic pronouns, which are composed of the plural clitic and the third person 

singular clitic, cf. §1.3.3.3.) The clitic version of this first person plural pronoun is =dahnn.  

Thus, this first person plural forms seem to be composed of "first person plural" plus "plural". 

The meaning of these pronouns may corroborate this, as I discuss below.   

9.  a.  dunnùu=da=hnn (TMZ; 5:158) 

1PL.BASE=PL=1PL 
'we; us' 
 

 

b.  N-u'uh=da=hnn   gahx:=gah   
NEU-be=PL=1PL  near=right  
'We are very near the house' 
 

yu'uh. (TMZ; 5:161) 
house 

While SLQZ only has one pronoun for 'we', another form =rënn is mentioned in an  

endnote.   

In  addition,  there  may  also  be  an  archaic  =rëhnn  (1  pl.  formal)  ending,  or  possibly  this  is 
characteristic of another language or dialect closely related to SLQZ. 

Munro and Lopez, in prep.:32 

 
While at first glance =rëhnn might not appear very similar to =dahnn, in fact their 

morphological composition seems almost identical, as the plural morpheme in SLQZ is ra (not 

da), and the first person plural clitic pronoun is =ëhnn.  Thus, both TMZ =dahnn and SLQZ 

=rëhnn seem to be composed of the plural clitic and a first person plural pronominal clitic. 

 
 

25 

  While the SLQZ form =rëhnn is identified as possibly being a formal pronoun, when TMZ 

speakers are asked to explain the difference between the two forms for 'we', most of the 

responses have to do with the number included in 'we', saying that the short form is for a few 

people (two or three) and that the long form is for many.  This may be supported by textual 

examples, such as the examples in (10) which are consecutive lines from a narrative about a 

wedding, where the two 'we' forms seem to correspond to two different groups: a large group of 

everyone attending the wedding (10a) and (10b), and a smaller group of the people actually 

involved in the wedding, including the storyteller, who will be accompanying the bride (10b).

tepache 

guehs  bahahzh. (TMZ; Sa:14) 

'When we all have gone to mass then the pot of tepache will get opened' 

 
 

 
 

  My best guess, based on the apparent morphological composition of dunnùudahnn 'we', 

narrative data such as those presented in (10), and comments from consultants, is that the short 

form is a paucal plural and the longer form is for larger plural or "multiple".  However, the 

determination of the meaning of these pronouns is a work in progress, as pinning the distinction 

down through elicitation has not been successful so far. 

 

(10) also helps to rule out a possible inclusive / exclusive distinction between dunnùuëhnn 

'we' and dunnùudahnn 'we', as I, the listener, am neither part of the group that will go with the 

bride to the church (paucal), nor part of the group that will go to the mass (multiple), as the 

wedding was to be held the following month in Oaxaca, and I wouldn't be there, and the 

storyteller knew that. 

  As I mentioned, the hypothesis that the distinction being made in these first person plural 

pronoun forms is that of paucal / multiple distinction isn't always convincing, and in some cases 

there seem to be contradictions, such as in (11) where the "paucal" free pronoun is used, and then 

later in the clause the "multiple" clitic pronoun is used as a possessor.  If my hypothesis were 

 
 

26 

right, this would mean something like 'Today he was born in David's hometown, one who will 

save us (few): he is Christ our (many) Lord'.  There may be ways to reconcile this with my 

hypothesis, however, examples such as these point out the need for more work.  One possible 

explanation is a semantic one: perhaps the narrator is saying that only few will be saved, while 

Christ is everyone's Lord, whether they will be saved or not.

'Today he was born in David's hometown, one who will save us: he is Christ our Lord' 
 

Another possible explanation relies on the lack of a vowel initial clitic form of dunnùuëhnn, as 

demonstrated earlier in (8c) and repeated below as (12c).   In fact, the use of the shortest clitic 

form =(h)nn seems blocked on consonant final stems, where one would expect a vowel initial 

variant of the clitic like <<=ëhnn>> to be used.  Instead, one of the other first person plural clitic 

forms is used: =dahnn (12a) or =nnùu' (which will be introduced below) (12c).

c.  *x:-yèe'cw=ëhnn (TMZ; 5:158) =(8c) 

bad with any meaning; e.g. cannot mean 'our dog' 
 

The final first person plural form is dunnùunnùu' (13a) with clitic form =nnùu' (13b).  I don't 

know if or how this pronoun differs in meaning from the other first person plural pronouns.  Like 

the other first person plural forms, the free pronoun seems to be built on the base dunnùu=.  My 

preliminary hypothesis is that this clitic form begins with the short clitic form =nn 'we' and may 

also contain the second person informal singular clitic =ùu' 'you'.  Since this is tentative at this 

point, I do not segment these in the data.  This hypothesis might also suggest that the pronoun is 

inclusive in meaning; however, based on my current data, this does not seem to be the case.

  Colonial Valley Zapotec (CVZ) also has several forms for the first person plural.  The longer 

form has two syllables and usually is written as tonoo or tono (as in (14)), although fortis / lenis, 

tone, vowel length, and phonation distinctions are not reliably conveyed in the writing of CVZ.  

The shorter form starts with n and is usually written as na, as in (15).  So far I haven't been able 

to determine anything about potential meaning differences based on our relatively small CVZ 

corpus, but I will continue to collect instances on them in hopes of developing an analysis.

1.3.3.2.  Second person pronouns 

 

There is a division between informal and formal in the second person.  Lìi' and làa'tuu' are the 

singular and plural informal free pronouns, respectively (16).

In addition to the informal forms, TMZ also has formal second person pronouns.  The 

singular free pronoun is yòo'byùu' (19a). Since the clitic form is =byùu' (19b) it seems that the 

base for the free pronoun is yòo', as segmented in (19a).  (Notice that the second person formal 

clitic seems to end in the second person informal clitic =ùu'.  Perhaps the =by is segmentable at 

some level as well.)

'What do you (form.) want?' 

There is only one form for the second person plural formal pronoun, which is yòo'bytùu'.  

This can be used as either a free pronoun (20a) or a clitic pronoun (20b).

29 

The formal plural forms seems to end in the second person informal plural clitic =tùu'.  This 

suggests that we may be able to segment it as yòo'=by=tùu' giving further support to the 

hypothesis above that yòo'= is the base for the second person pronoun clitics and that the formal 

pronouns are built using the informal pronouns along with the morpheme <<=by>>.  Given this 

hypothesis, though, we might expect there to be a clitic form for the second person formal plural 

(for which there is no evidence) of the shape <<=bytùu'>>.   

 

The second person pronouns in SLQZ are presented in Table 8 along with the TMZ forms.  

The forms in the two language varieties look related, although I don't present an analysis for the 

correspondence between the forms here, and there certainly are many obvious differences.  Note, 

however, that SLQZ has two sets of formal forms: one set with a b and one set without a b.  

Additionally, the formal forms in SLQZ also seem to end with the informal clitic forms.

1.3.3.3.  Third person pronouns 

As shown in Munro (2002), the third person pronoun system in TVZ is very complex.  TMZ, like 

SLQZ, has six third person pronouns, which seem to make hierarchical distinctions.  While 

SLQZ also has six third person pronouns (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999; Munro, Lillehaugen, 

and Lopez, in prep.) many do not seem to correlate in form with the pronouns in TMZ (Munro 

2002). 

 

In the following sections I describe the third person pronouns in TMZ: reverential 

(§1.3.3.3.1), respectful (§1.3.3.3.2), familiar (§1.3.3.3.3), animal (§1.3.3.3.4), proximate 

(§1.3.3.3.5), and distal (§1.3.3.3.6).  I will make comparisons to the third person pronouns in 

SLQZ throughout, and in §1.3.3.3.7 I present a summary of the third person pronouns in SLQZ 

for comparison. 

 

 
 

30 

1.3.3.3.1. Third person reverential 

 

The third person reverential pronouns are used for God, Jesus, and other holy things such as 

the angels or tortillas.  The third person free reverential pronoun is lài'ny (21) with clitic forms 

=iny (21a) and =ni' (21b).

clitics.  It seems from the examples in (21) that =ny occurs after a vowel (21a, c) and =ni' after 

an consonant (21b), but the plural forms of the pronoun seem to contradict that hypothesis: the 

plural free pronoun is làa'dani' (22a) and the plural clitic reverential form is =dani' (22b).

Unlike most of the pronouns, the plural form of the pronoun does not transparently consist of the 

plural marker da and the singular clitic.  If that were the case, we would expect the plural 

reverential form to be làa'dany with clitic form =dany.  I don't know how to account for this.  

The reverential pronoun is not very frequent, and possibly there is such a form that I haven't 

encountered.  However, it is probably relevant that there are two third person reverential free 

pronouns in SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999 (ML)): one that ends in =ny (23a) and one that 

ends in =ni' (23b), although there is only one plural form, which is based on the =ny clitic (23c).

The singular third person respectful pronouns are làa'b (free pronoun) (24a); and clitic forms =b 

(after a vowel) (25a) and =ba (after a consonant) (24a).  The plural forms are làa'dab (24b) and 

clitic form =dab.  This pronoun looks similar in form, though not in meaning, to the SLQZ 

formal pronoun làa'b (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:147).

The respectful pronouns are frequently used to translate an unspecified 'he' in elicitation 

contexts, but also seem to convey respect, as shown in the following examples, where the 

respectful pronoun is being used to refer to Mary, the mother of Christ (25a), and a group 

consisting of a mayordomo (which is a respected position as the host of a fiesta) and his guests 

(25b).

1.3.3.3.3.  Third person familiar 

 

The third person familiar singular free pronoun is làa'by (26a) and the clitic forms are =by 

(after a vowel) and =bi (after a consonant) (26a).  The plural free form is làa'daby (26b), and the 

clitic form is =daby.   There does not seem to be a third person pronoun in SLQZ that is related 

directly in form or meaning.

'they; them (fam.)' 

The third person familiar pronoun is used very frequently by my main consultant.  He often 

translates it as "con cariño [with affection]" and usually uses it to refer to people that we both 

know, even if we aren't particularly close to them.  (But it may be the case that these people are 

all younger that my main consultant, which may also be relevant.)  My understanding is that this 

 
 

33 

pronoun is used for children, babies, and people that you have affection for in general.  Perhaps 

"familiar" is not the best name for this pronoun, but it is my current working label. 

1.3.3.3.4.  Third person animal 
 
 

The free singular animal pronoun is làa'mm (27a) with clitic forms =mm (after a vowel) and 

=mma (after a consonant) (27a).  The plural free animal pronoun is làa'damm (27b).  This seems 

related to the SLQZ animal pronoun làa'mm (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:149) in both form 

and meaning.  One major difference in use, however, is that while the animal pronoun is used for 

children in SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:14) it is not in TMZ.  (The familiar pronoun 

(§1.3.3.3.3) is used for children and babies in TMZ.)

The proximate pronouns are singular làa'ni'ih (28a) with clitic form =ni'ih (28a) and plural 

form làa'dani'ih (28b) with clitic form =dani'ih (28b).  These pronouns  are primarily used for 

non-humans, but can be used to refer to people in certain contexts.  For example, my main TMZ 

consultant (who is male) told me that teenage boys might use it to one another, in a perhaps 

derogatory manner.  However, in some cases the proximate (and the distal) have been used to 

translate 'he' in what seemed to me to be a neutral elicitation context.

although more work is needed on this. 

1.3.3.3.6.  Third person distal 

 

The distal pronouns are singular làa'na'ah (29a) with clitic form =na'ah (29a) and plural 

form làa'dana'ah (29b) with clitic form =dana'ah (29b).  As with the proximate pronouns, the 

distal pronouns  are primarily used for non-humans, but can be used to refer to people in certain, 

perhaps insulting, contexts.

Table 9 presents all of the third person pronouns in SLQZ.  While I have referred to relevant 

forms where appropriate above, let me point out here that there does not seem to be a pronoun in 

TMZ that corresponds either in form or (from what I understand) meaning to the SLQZ 

respectful pronoun làa'zh: (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:149).  Also, as mentioned above, the 

proximate la'anng (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:146) and distal la'ai (Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999:146) seem significantly different in both form and use from the TMZ proximate làa'nìi' 

(§1.3.3.3.5) and distal làa'nàa' (§1.3.3.3.6).

1.3.4.  Word order 
 
In the following sections I present a basic description of word order within sentences and phrases 

in TMZ.  In §1.3.4.1 I discuss the basic word order in TMZ, contrasting it with the basic word 

order and other word order possibilities in SLQZ in §1.3.4.2.  Finally, in §1.3.4.3 I present the 

word order of phrases that will be particularly relevant in this dissertation: prepositional phrases 

and possessed noun phrases.   

 
 
1.3.4.1.  Basic word order in TMZ 
 
Zapotec languages are head initial languages.  In SLQZ, and many other Zapotec languages, the 

basic word order is VSO.  However, for TMZ the most common word order (at least in 

elicitation) is SVO, although VSO is possible, as shown in (30), where the √ indicates that the 

sentence was not volunteered, but was judged as grammatical and repeated by the speaker.

36 

Preliminary analysis of my small corpus of transcribed oral narratives suggests that VSO is 

significantly more frequent for my consultants in volunteered narration.  In my future work on 

TMZ I hope to be able to investigate this more in depth.   

 

Likewise, both VSO (31a, b) and SVO (31c, d) word orders are allowed for embedded 

clauses, regardless of the word order of the matrix clause: SVO (31a, c) or VSO (31b, d).

1.3.4.2.  Comparison of word order in SLQZ and TMZ 
 
In SLQZ the basic word order is VSO (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999, Lee 1999, and Munro, 

Lillehaugen, and Lopez, in prep.)  SVO is a possible word order, but is used to focus the subject, 

as explained in the excerpt from Cali Chiu8 below. 

                                                 
7 This seems to be the perfective form of re'ihpy 'tell'.  It corresponds with the SLQZ imperative form of 
this verb (gwu'ahts); although this verb has "no perf[ective]" form in SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et al. 
1999:247).

"The girl runs."  

It's possible to begin a Zapotec sentence with something other than a verb, such as a noun or 

  Verb plus subject is the most basic WORD ORDER used in Zapotec sentences… 
 
…  
 
a name: 
 
… 
In these examples, the subject comes first, not the verb. Speakers use this word order to show a 
greater emphasis, or FOCUS, on the subject. When the subject is before the verb, it is the subject 
specifically,  not  just  the  whole  event,  which  is  the  focus  of  the  speaker's  attention.  The  most 
common use of sentences like these is to answer a question like "Who runs?" or "What boils?", 
for example… In English, answers to such questions are often pronounced with more loudness or 
vocal  emphasis  on  the  focused  noun  or  name  corresponding  to  "who"  or  "what".  In  English 
translations in this book, we will represent English focus by underlining.  

"The girl runs."  

 
 
 

I am not sure if the SVO word order focuses the subject in TMZ, but SVO seems to be a 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 5 

neutral word order, at least in some contexts.  For example (32a) was volunteered as the 

translation of 'Pedro scared me', but (32b) was accepted as grammatical and repeated.  While this 

is not strong evidence and more work remains to be done, my current hypothesis is that SVO in 

TMZ does not carry the same type of subject-focus as in SLQZ.  Therefore, in this dissertation I 

do not translate SVO sentences in TMZ with focus.

TMZ also seems to differ from SLQZ in how objects can be fronted.  As shown below, in 

SLQZ an object can be focused by fronting it before the verb.  No special marking on the object 

is required.  Sometimes this results in an ambiguous sentence, and one needs to rely on context 

to know whether it is the subject or the object that is focused.    

                                                                                                                                                            
8 The orthography used in Cali Chiu (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.) underrepresents certain 
phonemic contrasts, including tone and phonation.  For a full explanation of the orthography, see Munro, 

 
 

38 

Mna re rcwany mniny. 

Guet re rnaz zhyap. 
Mes rguad manyser. 

"The girl grabs that tortilla."  
"The bee stings the teacher." 

Sometimes the situation is more complicated, however. Consider the following sentence: 

… sentences like the following involve focus on the object. The first sentence might be used to 
answer the question "What does the girl grab?" 
 
 
… 
 
 
 
Does this mean "This  woman  wakes up the boy" (for instance, in answer to the question "Who 
wakes up the boy?"), or does it mean "The boy wakes up this woman" (for instance, in answer to 
the question "Who does the boy wake up?")? In fact, we can't tell! The Zapotec sentence could 
have either of these meanings – all you know if you hear it is that the woman is the focus of the 
speaker's  attention.  To  be  sure  of  what  this  sentence  means,  you  have  to  consider  the  whole 
conversational  CONTEXT  in  which  the  sentence  is  used,  including  what  information  both  the 
speaker and hearer had and what had been said before. In any such context, the meaning of the 
sentence will be clear to the participants in the conversation. 

 

 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 5 

But in TMZ there are far fewer "ambiguous" sentences of this type, because not every object 

noun phrase can simply be moved to the pre-verbal position (33b).  In order to move the object 

in this case, the marker làa' needs to be used (33c).  See §1.3.5 for more information about làa' 

and this type of construction.

In SLQZ when a pronoun subject is focused, a free pronoun appears sentence initially, and a 

pronominal clitic is used after the verb.  It is not possible to have only a sentence initial free 

pronoun without the pronominal clitic, as explained below in a passage from Cali Chiu. 

                                                                                                                                                            
Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lessons 1 – 4. 
 
 

39 

 

Laëng bguadëng bar mes. 
Lai cacwanyi zhyet. 

"She poked a stick at the teacher." 
"He is waking up the cat." 

  Another  way  to  use  free  pronouns  is  when  you  want  to  focus  a  pronoun  subject,  as  in  the 
following examples: 
 
 
 
...  When  a  pronoun  subject  is  focused,  the  sentence  must  contain  not  only  the  focused  free 
pronoun at the beginning of the sentence, but also the bound pronoun subject attached to the verb. 
You can never begin a sentence with a focused free pronoun subject without including a bound 
subject pronoun attached to the verb.  
  A good way to think of how this works is to remember that any verb with a pronoun subject 
must have a bound pronoun attached to it. The bound pronoun attached to the verb is what tells 
you what the subject is. Adding a focused version of the pronoun at the beginning of the sentence 
is extra. A free pronoun can never be the only indicator of the subject of a sentence that contains a 
verb.  

 
  However, in TMZ, this very construction which is ungrammatical in SLQZ is allowed, at 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 5 

least in a some cases.  There is much about this construction that I do not know including the 

range of verbs is can occur with.  It also does not seem to be able to occur with the first person 

singular pronoun, though it can occur with all other pronoun subjects.  In addition, as of now it 

remains an open question as to the semantics of this construction.  I don't know exactly how (or 

if) the examples in (34) differ in meaning from each other.

NEU-be=3FAM near=very   
'He is very near the house' 

yu'uh (TMZ)

The final construction I want to compare is the "topic" construction in SLQZ which involves 

the use of both a pre-verbal nominal subject and a post-verbal subject clitic, as explained for 

SLQZ below. 

 
 

40 

These sentences all start with names or noun phrases, so they look like ordinary focus sentences. 
But  then  they  include  either  a  subject  or  an  object  pronoun  following  the  verb.  This  pronoun 
refers to the noun phrase at the beginning of the sentence. This is called a TOPIC sentence pattern. 
The name or noun phrase at the beginning is called the topic, usually someone or something that 
the  speaker  has  already  been  speaking  about.  Following  the  topic  is  a  complete  sentence 
containing a pronoun referring to the topic.

Such constructions exist in TMZ (35).  More research is required to confirm their use and 

 

meaning, but I will take as a starting hypothesis that they function like the topic construction 

described for SLQZ.

1.3.4.3.  Additional constituent order in TMZ  

Constituent order overall is consistent with head initial typologies.  Adpositions must precede 

their objects; i.e. they are prepositions.  This is true of both component part prepositions (38), 

and non-component part prepositions (36) and (37); native prepositions (37) and (38) and 

borrowed prepositions (36).  (The different types of prepositions will be discussed in §1.4.3.)

1.3.5.  Làa' 

The focus morpheme làa' and its cognates can be found in many Zapotec language varieties.  In 

SLQZ, this morpheme (when used independently) functions as a focus marker (Munro and 

Lopez, et al. 1999:149; Munro and Lopez in prep.:112; Lee 1999), as indicated in the dictionary 

entry below: 

lààa'  (foc[us]) {followed by n[oun]; Btàa'aza' lààa' Gye'eihlly, Lààa' Gye'eihlly btàa'aza' "It was 
Mike that I hit"; Tu bìe'd steeby nah, lààa' Lia Pahstiiny èe o lààa' Lia De'sy? "Who else came, 
now, Faustina or Modesta?"; Làa' Gye'eihlly chiia "It's Mike who's going to go"; Rro't btàa'az 
làa' Gye'eihlly "It was Mike that Rodrigo hit"} § comb[ination form] làa' ¶ làa'la'…  

  §§ Lààa' is often, but not always, replaced by the comb[ination form] làa' when used before a 

noun. Làa' is always used before a suffix. 

  §§ A foc[used] subj[ect] must preceded the v[erb].  A  foc[used] non-subj[ect]  may precede or 

follow the v[erb].  

Munro and Lopez state (above) that "A foc[used] subj[ect] must precede the v[erb]" (in 

Munro and Lopez, in prep.: 112;  Spanish omitted; italics added 
 

prep.:112).  SLQZ lààa' can be used before preverbal subjects to add semantic focus; compare 

(40b) with (40a).

IRR.go 

 

 
 

b.  Chiia     Gye'eihlly. (SLQZ) 
 
 

IRR.go    Mike 
'Mike will go' 

The fact that "a foc[used] non-subj[ect] may precede or follow the v[erb]" (Munro 

and Lopez in prep.:112) is exemplified below with examples from the dictionary entry 

where lààa' can be used to add focus to a post-verbal (41a) or preverbal (41b) object. 

41. a.  B-tàa'az=a'      lààa'   Gye'eihlly. (SLQZ; ML in prep.:112) 

PERF-hit=1SG   FOC   Mike 
'It was Mike that I hit' 

 
 
 
b.  Lààa'     Gye'eihlly

'It was Mike that I hit' 

b-tàa'az=a'. (SLQZ; ML in prep.:112) 
PERF-hit=1SG 

  Mike       

 
 
 
  As in SLQZ, a subject can be focused in TMZ by appearing in front of the verb preceded by 

làa' (42c).  This is easiest to elicit as a response to a question such as (42d).  

 
 

IRR.go

  However, the use of làa' with objects in TMZ seems to be different than in SLQZ.  It seems

'Who will go?' 

that some instances of the use of làa' are conditioned by something other than focus, because in 

 
 

43 

some cases the use of làa' before an object is obligatory, as in (43). Thus, in (43b), Jwaany can 

only be interpreted as a subject, since it is not preceded by làa'.

'John kicked the bull' / *'The bull kicked John' 

 
 
An analysis of làa' awaits further research.  In this dissertation I gloss TMZ làa' when used with 

objects simply as LÀA' instead of FOC, since my current hypothesis is that focus alone cannot 

explain paradigms such as those in (43). 

 
1.3.6.  Possession 
 
There are two main constructions that can be used to indicate possession.   The syntax and 

morphology of possession in SLQZ has been previously described (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999 

and Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.).  Please refer to these works for more detail as I 

will present only a brief summary of the constructions in TMZ here, and there remain many open 

questions, especially in regards to which type of possessive construction different nouns can 

participate in.   In the discussion, unless otherwise indicated, I follow the terminology used in 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.   

 

The first type of possession I will discuss is the optional possession construction (§1.3.6.1) in 

which the word x:tèe'n 'of' (or in certain conditions x:tèe') links the possessed noun and 

possessor (44).  The second type is essential possession (§1.3.6.2).  In this type of possession, a 

possessor can directly follow a noun to create a possessed noun phrase, as in (45).  The 

pronominal clitics used to indicate possession (as in (44a) and (45a)) are the same as those used 

to indicate subjects (§1.3.3).

n-quiets. (TMZ; 5:126)   
ADJ-white

(44) and (45) above.  However, other types of nouns can only participate in essential possession 

(46).

'My child is named Daniella'

  Danieel. (TMZ; 5:126)   

of=1SG  

 

 

 
 
 
 

1.3.6.1.  Optional possession 

Optional possession, as mentioned above, uses the word x:tèe'n 'of' to link the possessed noun 

and possessor.  Unlike in essential possession, in this type of possessive construction no 

morphology is ever added to the possessed noun. 

The simplest way to express OPTIONAL POSSESSION is to put the word xten [x:tèe'n] between the 
possessed noun and the possessor: 
 
 
 
 
  … 

possessed noun 
liebr 
guan 
camyuny 

"Pedro's book" 
"the man's bull" 
"my truck" 

possessor 
Bed 
buny 
-a 

xten

xten 
xten 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

OPTIONAL POSSESSION 1 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 14 
 

 
 

45 

Xtèe' can also be used to link the possessed noun and possessor in an optional possession 

construction, but only if the possessor is a noun phrase, as described below. 

Here is another optional possession pattern, using xte [x:tèe'] instead of xten. This pattern is only 
used when the possessor is a noun phrase (a noun, with or without a modifier, or a name, but not 
a pronoun).

OPTIONAL POSSESSION 2 

used only with noun phrase possessors 

 
There  is  no  difference  in  meaning  between  these  two  patterns.  Xte  and  xten  can  only  be  used 
with optionally possessed items, however, never with members of the family, parts of the body, 
or certain other items that Zapotec speakers always think of as essentially possessed.  

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 14 
 

As mentioned above, this type of possessive construction is used with things typically identified 

as alienable, as further explained below.   

Optional possession is used to show that someone owns an item or animal that you might think of 
as possessed or you might not. If you see a bull or a  book, it's probably the case that someone 
owns  it,  but  not  necessarily:  we  can  mention  the  owner,  or  not,  as  we  choose.  In  this  optional 
possession pattern, xten comes after the possessed noun, before the possessor. If the possessor is 
a pronoun, you use the same bound pronouns that you use for subjects… 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 14 

 

1.3.6.2.  Essential possession 

Certain nouns, including kinship terms and body part terms can only participate in the essential 

possession construction. They have been called "inalienably possessed" (Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999) and "essentially possessed nouns" (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.)  While the 

morphological category of inalienable possessed noun seems to be semantically based, there are 

some perhaps surprising members and non-members of this category.  For example zu'ùu'dy 

'corte (traditional Zapotec woman's wrap-around skirt)' (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: 

Lesson 14) is an essentially possessed noun (i.e. it must participate in the essential possession 

construction and cannot occur without a possessor or in the optional possession construction); 

 
 

46 

and gyihchi'ihcy 'hair' is not an essentially possessed noun (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in 

prep.: Lesson 14). But most nouns that are essentially possessed are things that would 

traditionally be classified as inalienable, as described below. 

In  Zapotec,  it  really  doesn't  make  sense  to  think  of  a  concept  like  "sister"  or  "head"  without 
remembering  that  a  sister  or  a  head  must  be  possessed  by  someone.  Although  possession  is 
optional with nouns like "bull" or "book", with possessed nouns like "sister" and "head", we have 
ESSENTIAL POSSESSION. Most nouns that are essentially possessed are kinship terms like "sister" 
… or body parts like "head" … 
  When  you  use  one  of  these  nouns  in  a  sentence,  you  must  mention  its  possessor,  because 
these  nouns  are  essentially  possessed  (we  call  them  E-POSSESSED  NOUNS,  with  e-possessed 
abbreviated as "e-poss."). Xte and xten are never used with e-possessed nouns. Here's the pattern 
used for essential possession: 
 
e-possessed noun 
 
bel 
 
bets 
 
zhinygan 
… 

"Gloria's sister" 
"the man's brother" 
"her son" 

 
 

possessor 
Lia Glory 
buny 
-ëb 

 
 
 

 

 

 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep. Lesson 14 

ESSENTIAL POSSESSION 1 

1.3.6.2.1. Essential possession of inalienably possessed nouns 

Most body and component part nouns in TVZ are obligatorily possessed.  They require a 

possessor, as explained below, which can be expressed with a bound pronominal clitic 

corresponding to the person and number of the possessor or with a noun phrase or name 

possessor.  This restriction, along with the head initial constituent order, is important to the study 

of component part locatives in TVZ, because component part prepositional phrases can be 

phonetically ambiguous with possessed noun phrases, since the object of the preposition follows 

the preposition and the possessor of the body or component part follows it.   

E-possessed nouns have to be used with a possessor...  Zapotec speakers often do not even like to 
say  e-possessed  nouns  without  mentioning  a  possessor.  If  you  ask  a  speaker  how  to  say  an  e-
possessed  word  like  "stomach",  he  or  she  may  say  lany  buny  "a  person's  stomach",  to  avoid 
saying the word by itself.  Thus, if you use a  word like  lany  without a possessor, you probably 
won't be speaking good Zapotec. 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep,: Lesson 14 

 
 

47 

1.3.6.2.2. Essential possession of alienably possessed nouns 

 

 

It is also possible to use the essential possession construction to talk about the possession of 

non-essentially possessed nouns.  To do this the possessed noun must first be turned into an 

essentially possessed noun through morphology, as explained below. 

 
 
 

xliebr Bed 
xcuan buny 
xcamyunya 

"Pedro's book" 
"the man's bull" 
"my truck" 

Another way to talk about the possession of optionally possessed items is to change these nouns 
into e-possessed nouns: 
 
 
 
… 
These examples use the same possessed noun phrases you saw in §14.1, but each possessed noun 
has a prefix x- [x:], and there is no xten or xte before the possessor, which appears right after the 
possessed noun, in the following pattern: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
… 

possessed noun 
e-possessed noun 
liebr 
cuan 
camyuny 

Bed 
buny 
-a 

 

x- 
 
x- 
x- 
x- 

 

possessor 

ESSENTIAL POSSESSION 2 

 
When the x- prefix combines with the possessed noun, this forms a new e-possessed noun. The 
possessed nouns in these phrases  (the ones starting with the prefix  x-) are e-possessed, so they 
must have a possessor. Although liebr "book" is an ordinary noun, whose possessor the speaker 
may choose to mention or not, xliebr is an e-possessed noun.  Just like the e-possessed kinship 
terms  and  body  parts,  an  e-possessed  noun  like  xliebr  cannot  be  used  in  a  sentence  without 
mentioning the possessor, and speakers may be reluctant to say this word on its own. 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep,: Lesson 14 

 

 
(47) is an example of this construction in TMZ, where the alienable noun amiu 'friend' has been 

turned into an essentially possessed noun with the addition of the x:- prefix, and can now 

participate in the essential possession construction. 

niilly  x:-amiu 

  mìi'iny. (TMZ; Zhat:35)

48 

  While this morphological process is fairly productive and most nouns seem to be able to 

participate in essential possession, some seem to be inappropriate, as the attempt to use essential 

possession to possess the borrowed noun Mini in Figure 8.  (The exact reason that this is 

inappropriate is not clear to me.  Certainly borrowed words can participate in this process, as 

shown in (47).) 

Do not attempt this at home! Here's a California license plate [Figure 8] that says "my Mini" in 
Valley Zapotec – but not all speakers feel that using the x- prefix on this kind of borrowed word 
is appropriate.

1.3.7.  Demonstratives 

TVZ languages have several sets of demonstratives, the full syntax and semantics of which I will 

not discuss here.  

 

Like SLQZ (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999; Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez, in prep.) TVZ 

has the demonstrative adverbs rèe 'there' and rèe' 'here'. 

rèe    1.  there;  2.  that  (dem.  adj.)  {bùunny  rèe  "that  person"};  3.  that,  that  one  (property)  (dem. 

pron.) {Rro'd bzììi' rèe "Rodrigo bought that one (that land, that house)" 

  §§ R- dem. are primarily used as adj. As pron., they refer only to real property. 
… 
rèe'  1. here {A lìu' zìe'dùu' rèe' "Here you come"}; 2. this (not so close) (dem. adj.) {bùunny rèe' 
"this person"}; 3. this, this one (property) (dem. pron.) {Rro'd bzììi' rèe' "Rodrigo bought this 
(this house, this land) … 

  §§ R- dem. are primarily used as adj. As pron., they refer only to real property. 

Munro and Lopez, et al..:248; Spanish omitted, italics added 

 
 

49 

In TMZ these r-demonstratives are also demonstrative adjectives meaning 'this' and 'that' 

 

respectively, and can occur after noun phrases.  Rèe' 'here' is very common, appearing at the end 

of the most common first person pronoun (§1.3.3.1) and often appears with the word for 'today', 

as in (48).  I do not know if the r-demonstratives can function as demonstrative pronouns in 

TMZ in the limited sense described above for SLQZ.

SLQZ also has the r-demonstrative pair re'nn and rèenn.  These do not occur in TMZ: 

re'nn  1. this (very close) (dem[onstrative] adj[ective]) {bùunny re'nn "this person"}; 2. here; 3. this, this 

one (property) (dem[onstrative] pron[oun]) {Rro'd bzììi' re'nn "Rodrigo bought this (this land, this 
house)"} 

  … §§ R- dem[onstratives] are primarily used as adj[ectives]. As pron[ouns], they refer only to real 

property. 

… 
rèenn  1. that (dem[onstrative] adj[ective]); 2. there; 3. that, that one (property) (dem[onstrative] 

pron[oun]) 

  … §§ R- dem[onstratives] are primarily used as adj[ectives]. As pron[ouns], they refer only to real 

property. 

 

SLQZ also has the demonstrative adverb pair ru'c here (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:269) 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:248; Spanish omitted, italics added 
 

and ri'cy 'there' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:268).  While I do not know if TMZ has ru'c, ri'cy 

'there' is attested, e.g. (49).

TVZ also has a set of n-demonstratives: TMZ has the demonstrative pair nndèe' 'this' and 

nndèe 'that', which also occur in SLQZ: 

 
 

50 

 

nndèe  that, that one (dem[onstrative] pron[oun]) § pl[ural] ra nndèe 
… 
nndèe'  this, this one (dem[onstrative] pron[oun]) § pl[ural] ra nndèe' 

§§ Prox[imate] dem[onstrative] pron[ouns] are not generally used to refer to hum[ans] because 
such reference to people nearby is considered impolite.   

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:194; Spanish omitted, italics added 

 

In TMZ these demonstratives can also function as demonstrative pronouns meaning 'this; this 

one' (50a) and 'that; that one' (50b).

The final pair of demonstratives that I will discuss are enclitics, and unlike most other pairs of

SLQZ does have a pair of clitic demonstratives, which may be cognate to the demonstratives 

above: they share some phonetic similarity, but I am not sure if they are related: =ahg 'this' and 

=ih 'that': 

=ahg,  =g    1.  this  (n[oun]  cl[itic])  {bèe'cwag  "this  dog"};  2.  himself,  herself,  itself,  themselves 

(n[oun] cl[itic]) {Gye'illyag bèèi'ny nìi "Mike himself did it"} 

Munro and Lopez, in pre.:52; Spanish omitted, italics added 
 
=ih    1.  (3sg.  dist[al]  cl[itic]);  2.  that  {bèe'cwih  "that  dog"};  3.  (3sg.  dist[al]  obj[ect]  cl[itic])  §

Verbal morphology in TVZ is rather complex, and I will not discuss it much in this dissertation.

SLQZ  verbs  are  inflectionally  very  complex,  usually  consisting  of  an  aspectual  prefix  plus  a 
theme  (forming  an  aspectual  stem),  with  optional  pronominal  clitics  to  indicate  all  non-third 
person subjects and third person subjects (in the absence of overt nominal subjects), and  clitics 
indicating certain third person objects; additionally, verb stems may be augmented by adverbial 
or  valence  clitics  or  suffixes  and  compounded  elements  that  come  between  the  theme  and  any 
pronominal clitics.  Verbs themes themselves may be complex, containing, for example, causative 
and directional elements prefixed to simple roots.  

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:13 

Like SLQZ, verbs in TMZ begin with an aspect prefix (in bold in the examples below), such 

as habitual (54a), perfective (54b), or irrealis (54c). 

bë'ëhdy   gui'idy  
 
chicken 

hen  

raa   
all   

zh:ih. (TMZ; 3:5)

I haven't yet investigated the meanings of the TMZ aspect markers in detail, although this is 

something I hope to do in the future.  That said, I also have not noticed any major differences 

from the description for the meaning and use of aspect markers in SLQZ (e.g. Munro and Lopez, 

et al. 1999; Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.).  In Table 10, I present a simplified 

summary of the meaning of aspect markers in SLQZ.  Please note that this does gloss over some 

complications, especially in regards to the definite aspect and z-progressive aspects.  For details 

on this please see the dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) and Cali Chiu (Munro, 

Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.).  Nevertheless, this chart should give the reader the necessary 

background for understanding the basics of the aspect system for the purposes of this 

dissertation.

1.3.9.  Conjunction 
 
In the following sections I discuss conjoining noun phrases (§1.3.9.1) and verb phrases 

(§1.3.9.2). 

 

1.3.9.1.  Conjoining noun phrases 

There are several ways to conjoin noun phrases.  They can be juxtaposed (55), with no overt 

marking of coordination.  They can be coordinated with the clitic =neh  (56) and with the 

borrowed conjunction cohnn 'with' (and its phonological variants) (57).  In the examples below, 

the phrases being coordinated are in boxes.

1.3.9.2.  Conjoining verb phrases 
 
TMZ appears to differ from SLQZ in the way that verb phrases can be conjoined.  In SLQZ there 

must be an overt nominal subject for each of the verbs, while in TMZ it seems that if the subject 

of the second verb is the same as the subject of the first verb, it can be omitted.

  While in many instances the first verb in such constructions is a motion verb (58) and (61), 

this is not always the case.  In (59) the first verb is 'lose' and in (60) the first verb is 'bark', neither 

of which are motion verbs.

This construction is only possible if the subject is nominal (60) and (61); if the subject in

Introduction to expressing location 

1.4. 

The following terms will be used throughout the dissertation: Figure, Ground, and locative 

construction.  A locative construction is any sentence or phrase that expresses a locative 

relationship.  I consider both of the sentences in (63) to be locative constructions; however, they 

have very different characteristics.   

63. a.  The cat is on the table. 

b.  The cat on the table is staring at me. 

 

In (63a) the locative relationship is asserted, and the relationship is between two entities: cat and 

table.  In (63b), the phrase the cat on the table shows that a locative relationship need not be 

asserted in a locative construction, but rather can be presupposed.  For the most part, the 

discussion in this dissertation will concern sentences of the type (63a), where one entity is being 

located in reference to another entity.   

The term Figure, as defined in (64), refers to the entity being located in a locative 

construction. For example, in (63), cat is the Figure in both examples.  

64. Figure: the entity being located in a locative construction, e.g. cat in the cat is on the table. 

 

My use of Figure is compatible with Talmy's definition of the same term (below), Levinson's 

(2003) use of the same term (further below), and Langacker's "trajectory" (1987). 

The  Figure  is  a  moving  or  conceptually  moveable  entity  whose  site,  path,  or  orientation  is 
conceived as a variable the particular value of which is the relevant issue  

 
…the thing to be located is the figure… 

 

Talmy 2000a: 184 

Levinson 2003:65 

  Although I will utilize examples like (65) on occasion in this dissertation, I will not specify 

what the Figure is in sentences like these. 

 
 

58 

 

65. The dog was sleeping under the table yesterday. 
 

The term Ground, defined in (66), refers to the entity in a locative construction that the 

Figure is being located in reference to. In the examples in (63) the Figure cat is being located in 

reference to the Ground table.   

66. Ground: the entity that the Figure (or an event) is being located in reference to, e.g. table in 

the cat is under the table.  

 
My use of Ground is compatible with Talmy's (2000a) definition "Ground" and "Reference 

Object" (below); Levinson's (2003) use of the same term (further below); and Langacker's 

"landmark" (1987). 

The  Ground is a reference entity, one that has a stationary setting relative to a reference frame, 
with respect to which the Figure's site, path, or orientation is characterized. In a linguistic context, 
the  term  Reference  Object  may  at  times  be  more  suggestive  than  Ground  and  will  be  used 
interchangeably with it from now on. 

 

…the thing with respect to which something is located is the ground… 

Talmy 2000a:184 

Levinson 2003:65 

 
  Consider (67), where the Figure dog is not being located in reference to an entity, but rather 

is being located deictically with an adverbial demonstrative.  For the purposes of this 

dissertation, unless otherwise specified, I will use the term Ground for referential Grounds only 

(i.e. excluding deictic Grounds). 

67. The dog is over there. 
 
 
1.4.1.  The basic locative construction 

In this section I offer a preliminary definition of the basic locative construction, which will be 

refined further in Chapter 5, and discuss the specific form of the basic locative construction in 

TVZ.  The basic locative construction is a complete sentence which asserts the location of a 

 
 

59 

Figure in relation to a Ground, (68).  In the basic locative construction both the Figure and the 

Ground should be full, lexical noun phrases.   

68. Basic locative construction: A complete sentence which asserts the location of a Figure in 

relation to a Ground.  The Figure and the Ground should be full, lexical (i.e. non-pronominal) 
noun phrases. [preliminary definition; see §5.2 for revised definition]  

 

1.4.1.1.  The basic locative construction in TVZ 

The basic locative construction is an operationally defined construction whose actual form is 

language specific.  The basic locative construction in TVZ can be schematized as in (69) (with 

variations discussed below). It consists of a Figure followed by a positional verb followed by a 

locational phrase.  (Positional verbs will be discussed in detail in Chapter 5.)  The Figure is the 

subject of the positional verb.  

69. Figure – Positional Verb – Locational Phrase (basic locative construction in TVZ) 
 

The locational phrase (which is represented in bold in (70) – (72)) may be instantiated in 

various ways.  For example, it may consist of a component part prepositional phrase ((70); see 

§1.4.3.1 and Chapter 2 for discussion of component part prepositions), a non-component part 

prepositional phrase ((71); differences between types of prepositional phrases are discussed in 

§1.4.3), or an adverbial demonstrative (72).  For locational phrases that are prepositional phrases 

the object of the preposition is the Ground. Various other types of phrases may also function as 

locative phrases in Zapotec, for example proper place names and the possessed form of 'house' 

(Munro 2005; cf. §1.4.4).

1.4.1.2. Variations of the basic locative construction 

The are several variations of the basic locative construction in TVZ. 

The basic locative construction may differ in word order.    Another common word order is 

Locational Phrase – Positional Verb – Figure, as in (73) below.

There are additional variants of basic locative construction as well; for instance some begin 

  me'es.  (TMZ; 5:147) 
 

loh  
on   

table 

 
 

 

with a particle or demonstrative adverb.  The particle a (bolded below) is often used at the 

beginning of locative sentences in SLQZ (75).  This can also occur in TMZ, although my 

 
 

61 

impression is that it is less frequent than in SLQZ.  (I use underlining in the English translation 

to represent focus.)

dehts     me'es. (SLQZ, CCL18)

dictionary defines this particle as follows: "(used before some preverbal subj[ects] with a-

pred[icates] or non-irr[ealis] v[erbs]; emphatic?)" (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:49).  In Cali 

Chiu (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.) this particle is defined and explained in the 

chapter dealing with expressing location, in reference to its use in locational sentences: 

Putting  a  before  a  focused  subject  of  a  locational  sentence  can  express  two  meanings. 
Often this type of sentence corresponds to ordinary focus, and might be used to answer a 
"where?"  question.  Sometimes,  though,  these  a  sentences  are  more  like  English  "there" 
sentences. 

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 18 

 

1.4.2.  The basic locative question 

A basic locative question is a question used to ask 'Where is the Figure?' There are two types of 

basic locative questions in TVZ.  The first, presented in (76), involves an initial question word 

'where', followed by a positional verb, followed by the Figure. 

76. Where

'Where is the bottle?'

The second type of the basic locative question in TVZ uses a question word but no verb, as in 

(77).

The question word cali must always be used with a verb (78b) and the question word cu'an 

cannot be used with a verb (78a).

Sonnenschein (2005) states that in San Bartolomé Zoogocho Zapotec (SBZZ), the different 

types of basic locative questions elicit different types of responses.  If the variant with a 

positional verb is used, the response is just a locational phrase, as in (79a).  The positional verb 

used in the question is implicit in the response.  (This means that the Figure, i.e. the subject of 

the positional verb, must satisfy the various restrictions the verb puts on its subject.  For a 

detailed discussion of positional verbs and such restrictions in TVZ, see Chapter 5, and in SBZZ 

see Sonnenschein 2005: 172-176).  Sonnenschein states that the response to this kind of basic 

locative question "presupposes the figure and the position"; for this reason no positional verb or 

subject is used, and the response consists only of a locative phrase (2005:122).  If the form of the 

basic locative question without a positional verb is used in SBZZ, the response will be sentential, 

complete with subject, positional verb, and locational phrase, as in (79b).

Although I have only briefly looked at responses to 'where' questions in TMZ, I have not 

noticed such a preference with my consultant.  For example, I asked him what an appropriate 

answer might be to (80a) and he volunteered (81a) and (81b).  I asked if (81c) and (81d) would 

be okay answers to (80a) and he said they would.  Then I asked him (80b) and asked him to reply 

 
 

63 

with a response.  Again, he gave (81a) and (81b).  So, again, I asked if (81c) and (81d) would be 

okay responses to (80b) and he said they would.  Certainly further investigation is warranted 

here, but initially it seems as though the two types of 'where' questions can be answered the same 

way in TMZ.

1.4.3.  Prepositions 

TVZ has different classes of prepositions. The most common way of classifying these 

prepositions is by the type of pronominal object they take.  In SLQZ the two types of 

prepositions are preposition "prep." and Spanish preposition "Sp. prep.".   

Prepositions.  There are two classes of Zapotec prepositions.  Many basic prepositional ideas are 
expressed with body part words…; the prepositional object is expressed either with a possessive 
pronominal  agreement  clitic  or  with  an  overt  noun  following  the  preposition. 
  Such 
prepositions…  are  identified  in  the  Dictionary  as  "prep.".    The  second  class  of  Zapotec 
prepositions, all borrowed from Spanish… and identified in the Dictionary as "Sp. prep.", express 
their objects similarly to verbal objects (with a following pronoun or overt nominal).  Both types 
of prepositional phrases, rather similarly to English prepositional phrases, generally do not need 
to be licensed in any special way by the verb of their clause. 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:24 
 

In Cali Chiu this same distinction is made between "native prepositions", which take bound 

pronouns as objects and "Spanish prepositions" which take free pronouns as objects.  These 

 
 

64 

syntactic classes in general align with the etymology conveyed in their names, but not always, 

i.e. there are "native prepositions" which have been borrowed from Spanish.  

"with me" 
"for you (form. pl.)" 
"behind it (dist.)" 

 
Zapotec has two types of prepositions. One group of prepositions, which includes cuan, par, 
trasde, and a number of others,  are primarily  words that were borrowed from Spanish —  we'll 
refer to these as SPANISH PREPOSITIONS. Objects of Spanish prepositions can be expressed with 
free pronouns:  
 
 
 
 
  …But  most  Zapotec  location  phrases  use  NATIVE  PREPOSITIONS,  not  Spanish  prepositions. 
Normally, a native preposition is a Zapotec word (not a borrowed word)…  The major difference 
between native and Spanish prepositions concerns how you express prepositional objects that are 
pronouns…  With  native  prepositions,  …  you  have  to  use  a  bound  pronoun  to  express  a 
prepositional object: 
 
 
 
  …Although most native prepositions are not borrowed, this is not always true. Here's another 
new native preposition. 
 
 
 
Puan [pu'ann] "on the peak of, at the top of" is a word that is borrowed from Spanish, but it is 
considered a native preposition, since, like native prepositions and unlike Spanish ones, it is used 
with bound pronoun objects rather than free ones, as the second example shows.  

"The bird is sitting at the top of the tree." 
"The bird is sitting at the top of it."

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: from Lesson 18 

 

I will use the terms "native preposition" and "borrowed preposition" to refer to the two 

classes of prepositions as described in Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez (in prep.) and Munro and 

Lopez, et al. (1999) above. 

 

In the following sections I introduce the various types of prepositions: component part 

prepositions, a type of native preposition (§1.4.3.1; which are treated only briefly here, being the 

main subject of Chapters 2 - 4); native non-component part prepositions (§1.4.3.2); and 

borrowed prepositions (§1.4.3.3).  

   

1.4.3.1.  Component part prepositions 

TVZ has component part prepositions that are derived from component part nouns.  Most of the 

component part nouns which have been grammaticized as prepositions are body parts, such as 

ni'ih 'foot; under' (82), and elsewhere (e.g. Lillehaugen 2003) I have referred to these 

prepositions as body part prepositions.

  However, it is not only body parts which have grammaticized in this way, but also other 

types of component parts, such as words for 'peak' (84).  For this reason, I think a better term for 

these is "component parts", which includes both the body parts and other compositional parts.   

  All component part prepositions take clitic pronouns (83b) to specify their objects, thus 

classifying them as a "native prepositions".

The cognate to pu'unnt in SLQZ is also identified as a native preposition, as discussed above. 

 

I present arguments for the syntactic status of component part locatives as prepositions in 

Chapter 2. 

 

1.4.3.2.  Native non-component part prepositions 

All TVZ speech varieties (and most likely all Zapotec languages) have non-component part 

prepositions.  Some of these are borrowed (§1.4.3.3), but many are native, such as x:tèe'n and 

x:tèe' 'of, about', which can be used in possessive constructions (§1.3.6), but can be used in non-

possessive contexts as well, as in (85).

All TVZ speech varieties also have prepositions which have been borrowed from Spanish.  Two

1.4.4.  Place names 

 

There seem to be a few nouns which can be the complements of locational verbs without a 

preceding preposition, as described in Munro (2005).  One such word is the possessed form of 

house: liihahz.  In some ways this seems parallel to some of the irregular behavior of English 

home: 

88. a.  I am going home. 

b.  *I am going to home. 
 

  Additionally "placenames", such as 'Santa Monica' (89a), 'Culver City', and even 'car wash' 

(89b) are not used with prepositions, as described by Munro (2005): "Placenames, whether 

borrowed or native, are never used with basic locative prepositions in Valley Zapotec".

Component Part Prepositions: Morphosyntax 

In this chapter I examine the morphosyntax of component part terms used in expressing location 

in Tlacolula Valley Zapotec (TVZ). I argue that component part locatives are prepositions in 

TVZ and provide syntactic diagnostics to support my conclusion. Many of the examples in this 

chapter available in audio format at AILLA (www.ailla.utexas.org), records ZAB005R007 and  

ZAB005R008. 

The use of body and component part terms to express location is an areal feature of Meso-

American languages (Campbell, Kaufman, and Smith Stark 1986) and has been specifically 

documented for Otomanguean in general (Kaufman 1974), and for Zapotecan (e.g. MacLaury 

1989; Munro in press; Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999; Lillehaugen 2003; Jensen de López 2002) 

and Mixtecan (e.g. Hollenbach 1995; Brugman and Macaulay 1986; Macaulay 1996) in 

particular.   

The following example shows the same word being used as a referential body part (1a) and in 

a locative expression (1b) in TVZ.

table 

component parts used in locative expressions.  (While most of the Meso-American component 

part locatives are body part terms, other languages use primarily component part terms.  For this 

reason, I am using the broader term "component part locative" since it covers locatives based 

both on body part terms and other component part terms.)  The category of component part 

locative is not specific as to the syntactic category of the component part term.  I will use the 

 

72 

 

term "component part preposition" to refer to a word related to a component part (either 

synchronically or diachronically) that functions syntactically as a preposition and the term 

"relational noun" to refer to a component part locative that functions as a noun in the syntax.  In 

this chapter I present arguments that the component part locatives in TVZ have been 

grammaticized as prepositions.   

 (2) – (4) below are a few more examples from TMZ where the same word is used to refer to 

a component part (in the examples labeled (a)) and in a locative construction (in the ones labeled 

(b)).  The component part term in each sentence is in bold.

Table 1. TVZ component part locatives and their meanings  

 

In this chapter I argue that TVZ component locatives are not so different from English 

prepositions like beside and inside which contain overt body part words.  (In the case of some 

component part locatives (e.g. cwe'eh 'beside') it may even be apt to compare them to English 

complex prepositions such as before and behind which contain antiquated body and component 

part words.)  I will give evidence that classifying component part locatives as prepositions 

provides for the simplest account of their syntactic distribution.  I contend that although these 

words historically developed from the component part terms, synchronically they are 

syntactically distinct. 

Below I first present perspectives on the categorial status of component part locatives in 

various Zapotec language varieties as background (§2.1).  I then show that most, but not all 

 

74 

 

component part locatives are related in form to a synchronic component part (§2.2) and that not 

all component part locatives in one variety function as locatives in other varieties (§2.3).  

I then argue that component part locatives in TVZ are prepositions by providing evidence 

from adjunction (§2.4), categorical selection (§2.5), coordination (§2.6), and modification (§2.7).  

I shows that the class of component part prepositions in TVZ is synchronically closed (§2.8), and 

that recognizing component part prepositions as such provides a structural account for certain 

types of ambiguity (§2.9).   

I discuss the issues related to the exact syntactic realization of component part prepositions in 

modern TVZ (§2.10) and in CVZ (§2.11).  Finally, in §2.12 I demonstrate the co-occurrence of 

component part terms with other lexical items, including nouns and verbs. 

 

2.1.  The debate over lexical categorization 

There seems to be no general agreement as to the categorial status of component part locatives in 

Zapotec and conclusions as to their status range all over the board: some researchers feel they are 

nouns even in their locative use and that their locative meanings are derived through synchronic 

metaphorical extension (e.g. MacLaury 1989, Jensen de López 2002); others feel they are 

emergent prepositions, but not synchronic prepositions (e.g. Sonnenschein 2004a, Beam de 

Azcona in progress), and yet others feel they are prepositions (e.g. Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999, 

Munro in press, Lillehaugen 2003).   While it is possible that component part locatives may be 

grammaticized to different extents in different varieties of Zapotec, it is nonetheless useful to 

consider the classification of component part locatives in other varieties, and especially to 

examine the arguments used to make this classification.  I will present the three main points of 

view below.  

 

75 

 

In a paper which explains in great detail the metaphorical system employed in the use of 

body parts as locatives, MacLaury (1989)  says of Ayoquesco Zapotec:  

Zapotec  does  not  use  body-part  terms  as  prepositions,  nor  even  as  markers  of  goal,  path,  and 
source…  [the]  body-part  locatives  are  not  prepositions,  because  there  is  no  justification  for 
setting them apart from their primary classification as nouns.  Unlike English prepositions, they 
are identical in form to the nouns applied to body organs, their use in syntax is optional, they only 
add specificity to other locative expressions, they do not complicate syntax, they do not denote 
direction, and they do not mark grammatical relations as do case markers.  

MacLaury 1989:120; bold added 

 

While MacLaury's comment is forceful, it occurs (partially in a footnote) in a paper which 

describes the system of metaphor employed in the use of body part terms.  Thus, the focus of his 

paper is not to justify his assertion regarding the syntactic status of these words, and in fact he 

says no more about this question.   

Jensen de López states of the TVZ variety, San Marcos Tlapazola Zapotec:   

Where English employs prepositions, Zapotec relies… on human body part nouns in referring to 
the spatial relationship between a trajectory and a landmark object.  Zapotec body-part spatial 
terms  are  nouns  or  noun-derived  items which are identical to the nouns used for referring to 
human body parts… The grammatical and semantic systems of the SMT Zapotec B[ody] P[art] 
terms are grammatically and semantically very different from that of Indo-European prepositions.            

 
But again, the categorial status of the component part locatives is not the focus of her paper.  

Jensen de López 2002:123; bold added 

  Others feel that the component part locatives are developing into prepositions in the language 

they study, but would not classify them as prepositions synchronically.  Sonnenschein says of 

San Bartolomé Zoogocho Zapotec: 

In  conclusion,  I  have  found  that,  while  they  [body  part  locatives]  are  definitely  a  separate 
lexical  class  from  garden  variety  nouns,  the  lexical  class  I  have  been  calling  body  part 
locatives  and  will  now  call  relational  nouns  are  also  distinct  from  prepositions  in  the 
language.  That  they  share  adverbial  morphosyntax  is  unimportant.  I  consider  the  semantic  and 
cross-linguistic  generalizations  to  have  shown  a  nascent  lexical  class,  and  one  which  fits  in  its 
own well defined point on the noun-preposition continuum, and shares many qualities with non-
body part, non prepositional locatives. Comparison both within the Zapotec language family and 
outside the family leads me to call these terms 'relational nouns', being careful to keep in mind 
that they form a chain, as described in Heine et al. and are definitely being grammaticalized on 
their way towards being prepositions, but have not yet gotten there.  

Sonnenschein 2004a:314, bold added 

 

76 

 

 

Beam de Azcona says something similar of Coatlán-Loxicha Zapotec (CLZ), although her 

arguments for the non-prepositional status of body part locatives are primarily based on the 

meaning of the body part locatives, and not their syntactic behavior.  As I will show in Chapter 

4, such argumentation is problematic (cf. Lillehaugen and Munro 2006): 

Many body part words in CLZ translate into English and Spanish with prepositions. When used 
in  this  way  they  are  not  reduced  or  otherwise  phonologically  altered…  The  would-be 
prepositional  phrases  appear  no  different  than  inalienably  possessed  noun  phrases  in  terms  of 
their  phrase  structure.  In  terms  of  the  larger  sentence  to  which  such  phrases  belong  there  are 
semantic and syntactic differences which occur on a continuum.  

Beam de Azcona in progress:197 

 

…[R]elational  nouns  in  CLZ  act  in  a  variety  of  ways  which  translate  into  European  languages 
with  prepositions.  In  some  constructions  relational  nouns  have  become  so  highly 
grammaticalized  that  we  can  regard  them  as  prepositions  synchronically  but  in  the 
majority  of  cases  examined  so  far  body  part  words  can  still  be  regarded  as  nouns,  though 
they  are  slowly  coming  to  function  more  like  prepositions.  I  regard  all  relational  nouns 
covered here in §3.3 (including §3.3.1) as emergent prepositions. However, these words lie along 
a  continuum  and  some  words  have  emerged  farther  than  others  towards  their  possible  future 
status  as  non-nominal  prepositions.  Words  with  body  part  core  meanings  are  more  saliently 
nominal. Relational nouns which do not have a synchronic body part meaning tend to be  more 
grammaticalized as prepositions, though a nominal analysis is still possible in many cases.  

Beam de Azcona in progress: 204 

 
However, not all linguists who work on Zapotec feel that the component part locatives are 

nouns.  Many researchers have analyzed component part locatives in their languages as 

prepositions.  Munro and Lopez, et al. say the following about SLQZ prepositions:  

There are two classes of Zapotec prepositions.  Many basic prepositional ideas are  expressed 
with body part words (e.g., lohoh "face" > "in" ["on"], gue'ehcy "head" > "on", cwe'eh "side" > 
"beside", dehts "back" > "behind"); the prepositional object is expressed either with a possessive 
pronominal agreement clitic or with an overt noun following the preposition.  Such prepositions 
(which  are  sometimes  difficult  to  distinguish  syntactically  from  the  corresponding  body  part 
words) are identified in the Dictionary as "prep.".  The second class of Zapotec prepositions, all 
borrowed from Spanish (e.g.  cëhnn "with",  pahr "for") and identified in the  Dictionary  as "Sp. 
prep.",  express  their  objects  similarly  to  verbal  objects  (with  a  following  pronoun  or  overt 
nominal).  Both types of prepositional phrases, rather similarly to English prepositional phrases, 
generally do not need to be licensed in any special way by the verb of their clause.   

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:24, bold added 

 
 

 

77 

 

Munro also points out that homophony with body part words is not enough to justify classifying 

body part locatives as nouns: 

The notion that the body part locative and relational words are not "true prepositions" probably 
reflects an idea that the "preposition" classification is inappropriate for words that have such an 
obvious  nominal  use  and  source,  recalling  MacLaury's  statement  that  "unlike  English 
prepositions, they are identical in form to the nouns applied to body organs". But many languages 
have  cases  of  homophony  (and  indeed  semantic  and  historical  relationship)  between  words  of 
different  lexical  categories.  The  English  word  down,  for  example,  can  be  used  not  only  as  a 
preposition  (as  in  down  the  street),  but  also  as  a  verb  (He's  going  to  down  the  beer),  a  noun 
(fourth  down),  and  an  adverb  (The  plane  went  down),  all  of  which  are  related;  this  does  not 
interfere  with classifying their parts of speech differently… but (as  Lillehaugen suggests) there 
are  certainly  English  prepositions,  such  as  behind  and  inside,  that have  the  same  form  as  body 
part words.           

Munro 2006:330 

 

Stubblefield and Stubblefield also appear to classify their component part locatives as 

prepositions in Mitla Zapotec:  

There are two classes of prepositions: those which are indeed prepositions, and nouns which can 
be  used  additionally  as  prepositions.  Some  nouns  which  refer  to  parts  of  the  body  and  which 
always appear  with a possessor are used  with an extended meaning as prepositions, in order to 
express a locative relationship1  

Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991:244  

 

2.2. 

 Component part locatives and their related referential component parts 

In this section I show the relation between the TVZ component part locatives and the related 

referential component part terms.  In most cases, each component part locative corresponds 

directly to a word for a body part, these will be discussed more in §2.2.3.  However, there are 

two locatives whose relation to a synchronic body part is unclear: cwe'eh 'side' (§2.2.1) and 

zh:àa' 'buttocks' (§2.2.2).   

 

In Table 2 I list the relevant body part words in question for four Central Zapotec speech 

varieties (three of which are TVZ speech varieties).  The forms that appear with a * are those that 

                                                 
1 This is my translation of their Spanish: "Hay dos clases de preposiciones: las que en sí son preposiciones 
y los sustantivos usados adicionalmente como preposiciones... Algunos sustantivos que se refieren a las 

 

78 

 

are not grammatical as referential body parts, and those that appear with a % have an unclear 

status.  The data in the TMZ column were obtained by eliciting the body part terms in a non-

locative frame that directly referred to the body part, namely "My ___ hurts."  The SLQZ data 

were obtained both from the dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) and from Munro's 

fieldwork and my fieldwork, with the assistance of Munro.  The SJGZ data were obtained 

through assistance of Olivia Martínez.  The Mitla Zapotec (MZ) data are from the dictionary 

(Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991).  As I did not have access to a speaker of MZ, I list the 

forms in Table 2 if Stubblefield and Stubblefield (1991) specifically say they are obligatorily 

possessed body parts.  Recall that body part nouns in TVZ languages are inalienably possessed, 

i.e. they require a possessor.  If the possessor is pronominal, it will be expressed with a bound 

pronominal clitic corresponding to the person and number of the possessor.  I present the forms 

in Table 2 without possessors for clarity, but the forms were all elicited with possessors (cf. (9)). 

                                                                                                                                                            
partes del cuerpo y que siempre se presentan con poseedor se usan con un significado más amplio como 
preposiciones, para expresar una relación de ubicación." (Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991:244)

Table 2.  possessed body parts in three Central Zapotec language varieties 

 
 
Table 2 summarized the relationship of the component part locatives to referential body part 

words.  Most component part locatives are related to a synchronic body part word.  However, 

there are two exceptions to this.  These will be discussed first in the following sections.  The 

relation of component part locatives to referential body part words is relevant to the questions of 

the syntactic status, of the calculation of the meanings of component part locatives, of whether 

the metaphor involved is synchronic or was a historical process, and of the stage of 

grammaticalization.       

 
2.2.1.    Cwe'eh 'side' 

Note that cwe'eh 'side' does not seem to be a component part word in SJGZ and for some 

speakers of SLQZ, evidenced by the fact that some speakers cannot say cwi'a'  to mean 'my side', 

although this means 'beside me'.  Speakers of SLQZ seem to vary as to what extent cwe'eh can be 

a component part word.  Some speakers allow this as a human body part.  Other disallow it, 

 

80 

though they may allow it as a component part of inanimates under the right circumstances 

(Munro p.c.).   

 

In TMZ, however, my consultant uses the word to refer to a human body part: 

 

cwe'=a'.  (TMZ; 5:58) 

HAB-hurt  side=1SG 
'My side hurts' 

5.  R-ahc    
 
 
 
 

There is also evidence that in Santo Domingo Albarradas Zapotec, a language variety closely 

related to the TVZ language group, the cognate to cwe'eh cannot be used as a human body part 

(Adam, in prep.).  It may be that the use of cwe'eh as a human body part in TMZ is innovative 

(Munro p.c.).  It seems then that for many TVZ language varieties there is no human body part or 

inanimate component part term cwe'eh.  As will be discussed more in §3.3, this component part 

locative cannot necessarily function by naming a part of the Ground, since for many speakers 

there is no possible referential noun cwe'eh.      

 

2.2.2.    Zh:àa' 'buttocks' 

Zh:àa' 'buttocks' seems to be a special type of component part in TVZ.   Munro and Lopez, et al. 

(1999) explain that in SLQZ, zh:àa' is a body part with a very specific meaning, which has 

complex restrictions on the type of possessor in that it "is almost never used without a n[ominal] 

(non-pron[ominal]) pssr. [possessor]"  (Munro and Lopez in prep.:375).  The dictionary entry 

below gives three component part meanings, which are in bold: 'bottom, buttocks'; 'handle (on a 

knife)'; and 'trunk (of a car)'. 

 

81 

 

zh:àa'    1.  bottom,  buttocks  {pssd.  only;  A  bu'uhdy  zubga'ah  gue'ehcy  zh:àa'  zhìi'mmy  "The 
chicken is sitting on the bottom of the (overturned) basket"}; 2. at the bottom of, on the bottom 
of  (prep.) {zh:àa' ca'j "at the bottom of the box"; O's nu'uh zh:àa' zhìi'mmy "The (toy) bear is 
on  the  bottom  of  the  basket;  3.  under  (prep.)  {Jwaany  zugwa'ah  zh:àa'  gyahg  cabèez  tèèi'dy 
nnyi'sgyihah  "John  is  standing  under  the  tree  waiting  for  the  rain  to  stop"};  4.  on  top  of 
(something upside down) (prep.) {A bu'uhdy zubga'ah zh:àa' zhìi'mmy "The chicken is sitting 
on  the  (overturned)  basket)};  5.  handle  (on  a  knife,  for  example){pssd.  only;  zh:àa'  bchiilly 
"knife handle"}; 6. trunk (of a car) {pssd. only; Bxèe'llya' zh:àa' ca'rr "I opened the trunk of 
the car"} 

… 
  §§  Although  zh:àa'  and  zh:ààa'n  both  mean  "bottom,  buttocks",  the  use  of  zh:àa'  is  more 
restricted.  This  word  is  almost  never  used  without  a  n[ominal]  (non-pron[ominal])  pssr. 
[possessor], and  may suggest  a dirty bottom {zh:àa'  mnìi'iny "kid's bottom";  zh:àa'  banguual 
"old person's bottom (that someone in a nursing home might have to clean up)"}; zh:ààa'n is a 
more general term. 

 Munro and Lopez in prep.:375; Spanish omitted; bold and italics added 

 

 

The data that I have for the use of zh:àa' in TMZ also suggest that pronominal possessors are 

not grammatical (6a), although pronominal possessors of zh:ààa'n are fine (6b), and non-

pronominal possessors of zh:àa' seem to be acceptable (6c).

I am not sure of the nature of the restricted meaning of zh:àa' in TMZ.  On the one hand,  my 

consultant said that (6c) and (7) meant exactly the same thing.   On the other hand, with all the 

discussion of zhàa' he volunteered the sentence in (8), offering (in English) the translation given, 

where zh:àa' may mean something different that 'buttocks'.

8.  R-nìi'b   
 
 

 
The translation of zh:àa' as 'booty' in (8), supports the note in the SLQZ dictionary, that zh:àa' is 

not a neutral or general term for 'buttocks'.  Further evidence of this can be seen below in the 

SLQZ translation of "The Hokey Pokey" (Munro p.c.), presented below in the simplified 

orthography of Cali Chiu (Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez, in prep.), which under represents 

certain phonemic contrasts including tone and phonation. In this song, the best way to refer to 

'your rear end' is with xcaderu, which looks related to the Spanish cadera 'hip' (Munro p.c.).  

Using zh:àa' or zh:ààa'n in this song would not be appropriate (Munro p.c.). 

Bzeby xcaderu nez loo, 
Bzeby xcaderu nez detsu, 
Bzeby xcaderu nez loo, 
Beinysesi axta ganu. 

Put your rear end in front of you, 
Put your rear end in back of you, 
Put your rear end in front of you, 
Shake it until you get tired. 

 

from Hoke-Poke 'The Hokey-Pokey', Munro p.c. 

While more work can be done on this morpheme, its behavior in terms of the type of possessor is 

enough to warrant being cautious about simply be lumped together with the more canonical 

component part terms, presented in §2.2.3.  

 

2.2.3.  The remaining component part terms 

The sentences provided in (9) are given as evidence that the remaining component part locatives 

are related to synchronic body parts in TMZ.  This frame helps confirm this status, since simply 

asking a speaker what a word means in isolation may provide results that are hard to interpret.  

For example, some speakers of SLQZ will translate cwe'eh as 'side' when asked what it means, 

and yet find sentences such as Rahc cwi'a' 'My side hurts' ungrammatical.  For this reason, I 

 

83

2.3.  Component part locatives in Valley Zapotec 

In Table 3, I summarize which component part terms can be used in locative constructions in the 

four Central Zapotec varieties considered above. The component part term appears in bold and 

the cell appears shaded if that term is used in locative constructions in that speech variety, and 

appears in plain type in an un-shaded cell if I have no evidence that it can be used in a locative 

construction in that speech variety.  If a cell contains "—", I was unable to find the relevant data, 

i.e. I could not find a cognate word in the MZ dictionary.

provided by Martínez (p.c.).  "—" mark cells in which no cognate could be found. 

Table 3.  Central Zapotec component part locatives  

 

All of the component part terms above the dark line in Table 3 (i.e. zh:àa' 'buttocks' and 

above) seem to be used in locative constructions in all four of the Central Zapotec varieties 

presented.  For those above the dotted line (i.e. zh:ààa'n 'buttocks' and above) I have evidence 

that they are used in locative constructions in TVZ, but not in MZ.  For those below the dotted 

 

85 

line, there is variance within the TVZ varieties as to whether the word can be used in a locative 

 

construction.   

 

2.4.  Adjunction 

Evidence can be taken from adjunction that component part locatives are not synchronic nouns.  

Consider intransitive verbs, which by definition do not take complements (excluding perhaps 

cognate objects, e.g. 'I sneezed a loud sneeze').  As can be seen below, intransitive verbs require 

no complement (10a).  Some types of phrases are allowed as adjuncts, such as làa'any yu'uh 

(10b), but others are not, such as yu'uh in (10c).   

10. a.  Cay-ùu'll=na'ah.  (TMZ) 
 
 
 

PROG-sing=3DST 
'He is singing' 

 
 

b.  Cay-ùu'll=na'ah 
 
 

PROG-sing=3DST   in   
 
'He is singing in the house' 

làa'any          yu'uh.  (TMZ) 

 

house 

c.  *Cay-ùu'll=na'ah   yu'uh.  (TMZ) 
 
 

PROG-sing=3DST   house 
bad with any meaning; e.g. cannot mean 'He is singing at / by the house' 

 
 

 

 
 
 

The difference in grammaticality between (10b) and (10c) suggests that làa'any yu'uh 'in the 

house' and yu'uh 'house' are not of the same syntactic category.  Làa'any yu'uh 'in the house' can 

function as an adjunct in the sentence while the noun phrase yu'uh 'house' cannot, even though 

one might expect that yu'uh 'house' could semantically function as a location for the singing.  Put 

another way, the word làa'any 'in' in (10b) seems to license the presence of yu'uh 'house'. 

Furthermore, example (10b) above clearly shows that it is not the case that component part 

locatives "only add specificity to other locative expressions" (MacLaury 1989).  There is no 

other morpheme that locates the Figure in reference to the house in (10b) beside làa'any 'in'.  

Consider the following intransitive sentences as well: 

 

86 

11.  a.  N-iga'ah-ye'ihsy=na'ah         cwe'eh   
 
beside    
 
 

NEU-lie-sleep=3DST     
'He is sleeping beside the house' 

 
 

 

 

 
 

yu'uh.  (TMZ) 
house 

b.  N-iga'ah-ye'ihsy=na'ah         
 
 

NEU-lie-sleep=3DST      
'He is sleeping in the house.' 

 

làa'any             yu'uh.  (TMZ) 
in    

house 

 

 

c.  N-iga'ah-ye'ihsy=na'ah 
NEU-lie-sleep=3DST      
 
 
'He is sleeping behind the house.' 

dehts     
behind  

 
 

 
 

yu'uh.  (TMZ) 
house 

 
 
 

 
 
 

In (11) above, again the only morphemes that locate the Figure in relation to the Ground are 

the component part locatives. 

 

2.5.  Categorial Selection 

Another piece of syntactic evidence that the component part locatives are prepositions comes 

from the categorial selection (c-selection) of verbs.  The ability of verbs to require the 

complement they select to be of a certain grammatical category is referred to as c-selection.  A 

particular issue with component part locative phrases in TVZ languages is that they are always 

phonetically ambiguous with (at least potential) possessed noun phrases, since the object of the 

preposition follows the preposition (12a) and the possessor of the body part also follows it (12b).

Consider (13a), below, where the verb zùub 'sit' c-selects a complement, which I've put in 

bold.  Note that zùub 'sit' requires such a complement, and is not intransitive, as its English gloss 

 

87 

 

may suggest (13b).  What is the syntactic category of this complement?  Following MacLaury's 

(1989) assumptions about the status of component part locatives, one could claim that the entire 

phrase is a noun phrase, 'the table's foot'.  However, if this category is nominal, then this verb 

ought to be able to c-select other noun phrases as complements, but, as shown in (13c), this is not 

possible.  Perhaps the verb has some way to specify that its complement must be a possessed 

noun.  Although this seems unlikely,2 it is also easy to show that this type of selection won't 

work, because then other possessed nouns should also occur as complements, and as we can see 

in (13d), this is not possible. 

13.  a.  Bèe'cw  

zùub         ni'ih       me'es.  (SLQZ)

b.  *Bèe'cw   zùub.  (SLQZ)

c.  *Bèe'cw   zùub           me'es.  (SLQZ) 
   

  dog         NEU.sit       table 
bad with any meaning; e.g. cannot mean 'The dog is sitting by / at the table' 

d.  *Bèe'cw    zùub        x:-me'es=a'.  (SLQZ) 
    

POSS-table=1SG 

  dog         NEU.sit  
bad with any meaning; e.g. cannot mean 'The dog is sitting by / at my table' 

 

                                                 
2 Thanks to Bernard Comrie for suggesting the following example of a verb that seems to select for a 
possessed noun.  In English, the verb envy in its ditransitive form seems to require that the indirect object 
be possessed (and be possessed by the direct object).  Indeed, a quick Google search of the string "envy 
him his" produces a myriad of results, while "envy him the" produces results of several (limited) types, 
including the one presented in (c), but apparently lacking any of the type in (b).  Similar facts seem to 
hold for English begrudge (d) – (f). 

 
a. 
I envy him his car.   
b.  *I envy him the car.  
 
c.    I envy him the car he bought. 

 
 

d.  I begrudge him his success. 
e.  *I begrudge him the success. 
f.  I begrudge him the success he has enjoyed. 

 
However, as was pointed out by Carson Schütze, it may be that something other than possession is at play 
in this cases, as evidenced by the following examples: 
 

h.  I begrudge him every success.  

g.  I envy him every success. 

 

 

88 

 
 
 

 

 

It is not the case, then, that these verbs select for nouns in general (13c) or for possessed 

nouns (13d).  Now consider the examples below, where we see that in addition to component 

part locative phrases, positional verbs may select for complements that are locative 

demonstrative adverbs (14a), and non-component part prepositional phrases (14b).  

14. a.  Bèe'cw  

zùub         ri'cy. (SLQZ) 

dog         NEU.sit  
'The dog is sitting there' 

there 

 

 

b.  Bèe'cw  

zùub 

 
dog         NEU.sit  
'The dog is sitting behind the table' 
 

tráhsdeh   me'es. (SLQZ) 
behind  

table 

 

So far, then, we have seen that positional verbs c-select for prepositional phrases (whether a 

component part preposition or a borrowed preposition) or demonstrative adverbs (which can be 

seen as pro-forms for prepositional phrases.)  In further support of this, consider the example in 

(15) which shows that it is not the case that a phrase beginning with any component part word 

will satisfy the selectional restrictions of the verb.  Dyahg 'ear' is a body part word, but it is not a 

component part locative. 

15. *Bèe'cw   zùub           dyahg    me'es.  (SLQZ) 
 
 

  dog         NEU.sit        ear         table 
bad with any meaning; e.g. cannot mean 'The dog is sitting by the table's ear' 

 

The patterns presented in (13) – (15) seem to pose a critical problem for the analysis of 

component part locatives as synchronic nouns.  If one were to maintain this analysis, one would 

have to specify that only phrases beginning with a closed set of nouns can occur as complements 

of positional verbs such as zùub 'sit', which would be stipulative and miss an obvious 

generalization: the component part locatives function differently from other body and component 

part words in the syntax. Component part locatives form a syntactic category in TVZ, which 

patterns in many ways with other prepositions in the language (e.g. positional verbs select for 

locational phrases, which can be demonstrative adverbs, any type of locational prepositional 

 

89 

phrase, and other special adverbial nominals such as place names (cf. Munro 2005 and §1.4.5) 

and therefore should be syntactically classified as a type of preposition. 

 

 

2.6.  Coordination  

The widely assumed principle of categorical harmony states that only like constituents can be 

coordinated.  Below I give evidence that component part locative phrases can be coordinated 

with both native non-component part prepositional phrases (16a) and borrowed prepositional 

phrases (16b), thus suggesting that they are of the same syntactic category.  These coordination 

facts provide yet more support the analysis of component part locatives as prepositions.

When component part locatives are used in locational constructions in TVZ languages, they 

cannot be modified in the ways that nouns can: they cannot take the plural marker, or be 

modified by quantifiers, numbers, or adjectives.  In this way, component part locatives can be 

described as appearing in a "decategorialized" form (cf. Hopper and Thompson 1984, Heine et 

al. 1991).  Heine et al. present an example from Ewe (Niger-Congo) to demonstrate 

decategorialization; the word ná can be seen meaning 'give' (17a) and 'for' (17b).  When ná 

means 'for' "it no longer accepts verbal inflections such as tense, aspect, or negation markers" 

(Heine et al. 1991: 2). 

 

 

90 

 

17. a.  me-ná        ga          

kofí  (Ewe, Heine et al. 1991, ex  1)3 

1SG-give   money    Kofi 
'I gave Kofi money' 

 

 
 

b.  me-w   

d'       vévíé   ná     dodókp   lá  (Ewe, Heine et al. 1991, ex  3) 

1SG-do   work   hard    give   exam        def.det 
'I worked hard for the exam.' 

The behavior of TVZ component part prepositions is very much parallel to this.  In the 

following sections I present data and argue that TVZ component part prepositions cannot take 

the plural marker (§2.7.1), cannot be preceded by quantifiers (§2.7.2); cannot be preceded by 

numbers (§2.7.3); and cannot be modified by adjectives (§2.7.4). 

 
2.7.1.  Plural 

In TMZ, the plural marker da precedes the noun which it modifies, as can be seen in (18).  A 

noun may sometimes be interpreted as plural without being marked with da, but marking a noun 

with da requires that it have a plural interpretation. 

18. Me'eu   

da    me'es. (TMZ) 
PL   

table 

dirty 
'The tables are dirty' 

 
 

The plural marker can precede a component part term when that word is functioning as a 

noun, as in (19).  Here loh me'es is the noun phrase 'tabletop'. 

19. Me'eu   
 

da      loh    me'es. (TMZ) 
PL 

table 

dirty 
face  
'The tabletops are dirty' 

 
It is also possible that the component part preposition loh 'on' take a noun phrase complement 

that begins with the plural marker da (20).   

 

20. B-zùu=a' 

 
PERF-put=1SG   
'I put the cups on the tables' 

da  ba's 
PL  cup  

loh

da    me'es. (TMZ) 
PL   

table 

                                                 
3 Some of the abbreviations in the glosses from the Heine et al. data have been adjusted to correspond to 
the abbreviations used in this dissertation.  

 

91 

 

 
  However, it is impossible to use the plural marker to modify a component part term when it 

is functioning as a preposition.  Consider (21) below. One might imagine that this sentence could 

be grammatical if loh were the noun 'face' here. Via metaphor the sentence could mean 

something like 'I put the cups at / by the faces of the tables'.  However, this sentence is 

ungrammatical.  Specifically, the ungrammaticality lies in the fact that the plural marker da 

cannot modify the word loh, because in this sentence, loh 'on' must be a preposition.

2.7.2.  Quantifiers 

 

Quantifiers precede the nouns which they modify, as seen in (22) below.   
 
22. Cantidaa  gyizhi'iilly  
  many 
 
      'Many chairs are green' 
 
Quantifiers may modify component part terms when they function as nouns as in (23a), and may

  Component part prepositions, however, cannot be modified by quantifiers (24).4

4 The example (a) below may be a counter example to my claim, where raa 'all' appears directly before 
and appears to modify làa'any 'in'.  Raa is also used later in the sentence to modify another locational 
phrase.  I'm not sure of syntactic or semantic function in either clause, so for now I will simply mention it 
here as something that remains to be explained.

2.7.3.  Numbers   

Like quantifiers, numbers precede the nouns which they modify in TVZ, as can be seen in (25) 

below.  In (25a), the number is modifying a simple noun 'table'; in (25b), it is modifying the 

possessed noun phrase 'tabletops', which begins with the component part term loh 'face'; in 

(25c,d), the number is modifying the nominal complement of the preposition.

2.7.4.  Adjectives 

Adjectives follow the nouns they modify in TVZ, as demonstrated in (27), where the adjectives 

modify a simple noun (27a), a possessed component part noun (27b), and a noun that is the 

complement of a component part preposition (27c). 

27. a.  B-tìia=a' 

 

 
PERF-paint=1SG

  Why are modified component part locatives ungrammatical?  If one analyzes the component 

part locatives as syntactic nouns, these results are surprising.  However, if component part 

locatives are analyzed as syntactic prepositions, the ungrammaticality of component part 

prepositions modified by adjectives, numbers, quantifiers, and the plural marker becomes 

expected, as prepositions in the language cannot be modified in this way.  Next I will explicitly 

compare the predictions made by a component part locative as noun analysis and a component 

part locative as preposition analysis. 

  Below I present two different analyses of a sentence with a component part locative.  In 

hypothesis one (H1) the component part locative is analyzed (and glossed) as a noun (29a).  In 

 

94 

 

hypothesis two (H2) the component part locative is analyzed (and glossed) as a preposition 

(29b).  I will show that the facts just presented about the types of modification allowed for 

component part terms argue in favor of H2, and are incompatible with an analysis of component 

part locatives as nouns (H1).  (Note that in presenting H1, an analysis where component part 

locatives are nouns, we are also required to accept that positional verbs may take a noun phrase 

complement, which I have already shown is not true (§1.4 and §2.5).  I mark this by including 

the locative gloss 'AT' as part of the meaning of the positional verbs in all the H1 sentences.  In 

the end, there will be many reasons why H1 is not valid, but for the purpose of this 

demonstration I wish to focus on the one at hand (modification) and thereby set the others (such 

as c-selectional properties of positional verbs) aside for a moment.

  Below, the possessor of the component part term is modified with an adjective in (30a) and 

the noun phrase object of the component part preposition is modified with an adjective in (30b).  

If a grammar allows noun phrase complements of positional verbs, then these different 

hypotheses make no different predictions regarding the grammaticality of constructions such as 

these.

For cases in which the component part term is a noun modified by an adjective, both 

hypotheses predict the same results, since in both cases, the component part would be treated as a 

noun.  This is shown below in (31).

  Below, the component part terms are being modified by an adjective (32).  Here, the different 

hypotheses make crucially different predictions.  Under the analysis that component part 

locatives are nouns, the ungrammaticality of (32a) is unaccounted for.  Why can't this noun be 

modified by an adjective?  We saw in (31a) that this same string is grammatical.  On the other 

hand, if the component part locatives are prepositions, the ungrammaticality of (32b) is 

accounted for and predicted, under the assumption that adjectives can modify only nouns in 

TVZ, not prepositions.  (32b) would require 'yellow' to modify 'under', apparently meaning 

something like 'The dog is yellow-under the table', but this type of modification is not possible: 

adjectives cannot modify prepositions.

Component part locatives in TVZ behave very differently from nouns: they cannot be 

modified by the plural marker, quantifiers, numbers, or adjectives.  I have shown that modified 

component part terms are not grammatical as component part locatives, because TVZ component 

part locatives are prepositions and component part terms modified by adjectives, numbers, 

quantifiers, or the plural marker are necessarily nouns.  The data presented here provide support 

for my claim that component part locatives, though identical in form to component part nouns 

and historically derived from them, are not synchronically nouns.  

It would be nice to also be able to provide evidence that there are ways that prepositions can 

be modified in TMZ that are not allowed for nouns, e.g. perhaps certain types of adverbs such as 

straight through the door, completely in the hole, right on the shelf, or almost over the wall. 

Unfortunately, so far I have not found any adverbs that only modify prepositions.  Some 

adverbial type words such as the clitic =ihzy 'only' can modify prepositions, but can also modify 

nouns, among other things.  The distribution of such morphemes, then, is not a useful diagnostic 

on its own, since I am looking for ways to test the syntactic difference between prepositions and 

nouns.

2.8.  Component part prepositions as a synchronically closed class 

Not all possessed component part can be used in locative constructions, even if they can be used 

metaphorically to refer to a part of a person, animal, or inanimate item.  For example, in (33a) 

below, guihche'ehcy 'hair' can be used to referentially, but in (33b) we see that it cannot be used 

as a locative: 

33. a.  X:-quihche'ehcy=a'    me'eu. (TMZ; 5:78) 

POSS-hair=1SG  
'My hair is dirty'

Thus, in TVZ, component part prepositions comprise a closed class of words and other 

component parts cannot be used as prepositions, even playfully.  (34) provides a further example 

of this, with the component part ca'ch 'horns'.  These can be used referentially to refer to the 

deer's antlers (34a), but cannot be used as a component part locative (34c).  Instead, if the deer's 

horns are to be used as a location, it must be proceeded by a component part preposition, such as 

làa'any in (34b).

2.9.  Explanation for ambiguous sentences 

Recognizing that component part prepositions are syntactically distinct from component part 

nouns in TVZ also provides explanatory power.  Consider sentence (35a) below, which is 

ambiguous between 'He is painting (while) inside the church'  and 'He is painting the inside of 

the church (e.g. the inside walls and the ceiling of the church itself)'.  The difference in meaning 

comes from a difference in syntactic structure.  The first meaning corresponds to the structure in 

which làa'any ydòòo' is a noun phrase complement of the verb, as in (35b).  The verb 'paint' is 

optionally transitive and the item that is being painted can be left unexpressed as in (35c) below.  

The second meaning in (35a) can be explained by viewing làa'any ydòòo' as a prepositional 

phrase adjunct, as illustrated in (35d).  So, although the sentences (35b) and (35d) are string 

identical, they are structurally distinct, giving rise to the difference in meaning. 

35. a.  Ca-tìaa'=na'ah                

làa'any           ydòòo'.  (TMZ)

in            
 

 

PROG-paint=3DST   
'He is painting (while) in the church' 

 
 
 
If one were to analyze component part prepositions as synchronic nouns, one would have to say 

ydòòo'] (TMZ) 
church 

something additional in order to account for the meaning difference between these sentences, if 

one wished to derive the semantics from the syntactic structure.  By recognizing the structural 

difference between these two types of sentences, the different semantics is easily accounted for.

2.10. 

  The syntactic realization of component part prepositions 

The exact syntactic realization of TVZ component part prepositions remains an open question.  

Below I will present several possibilities and discuss the types of data I might need to evaluate 

these hypotheses.  There are two main distinctions to discuss: the first relates to the nature of the 

prepositional head and the second relates to the type or level of prepositional head involved. 

 

  As for the nature of the prepositional head, the data I have presented in this section clearly 

argue for an analysis of component part locative phrases as prepositional phrases.  However, 

there could be (at least) two possible realizations of this: the head of the phrase could be the 

component part locative, as in (36a), or it could be a null prepositional head, as in (36b).

b.  component part locative as nominal complement of null prepositional head 

I believe some of the data presented in this section could be used in evaluating these 

hypotheses.  In the case of (36b), the analysis would require that the null prepositional head 

 

100 

 

select for a possessed noun phrase beginning with one of the closed class of component part 

locatives.  This brings up many of the same issues discussed regarding verbal c-selection in §2.5.   

 

In addition, under the null-prepositional head analysis, the TVZ component part locatives 

would be nominal complements perhaps akin to front in English in front of.  If this were the case, 

it may be possible to find evidence of the nominal status of the component part locative.  In §2.5 

I showed the component part locatives may not be modified as nouns can, but this may not be 

strong enough to rule out this possibility. 

 

It may seem as though semantics may help in this determination, but given the data I present 

in Chapter 4, I feel that meaning and semantics cannot be used to determine the syntactic 

category of a component part locative. 

  An additional open question has to do with the type of prepositional head involved.  Recent 

work by Koopman (1997) gives evidence from Dutch that what we might think of as a "PP" 

actually contains a large architecture of other phrases. For prepositional phrases which represent 

paths, there are two additional projections above CPPLACE (not represented in Figure 2) the 

highest being DegPATH, which selects for a PathP, which in turn selects for a CPPLACE, the 

structure of which is shown below in Figure 2.

Figure 2. the structure of a "prepositional phrase" (based on Koopman 1997, ex 107) 

The tests Koopman (1997) uses in Dutch to argue for such a structure are, not surprisingly, 

 

 
 

not necessarily replicable in TVZ.  However, I may be able to find some relevant data in future 

work to evaluate this structure for TVZ. 

 

2.11.  The syntax of CVZ component part locatives 

At this point I do not have enough evidence to make a strong conclusion about the syntactic 

category of component part locatives in CVZ.  While there is evidence that component parts 

were used as locatives in CVZ, there is no direct evidence that they were prepositions at the time.  

Neither was there any direct evidence that they were nouns.  For this reason, I gloss all CVZ 

component part locatives with their referential component part meaning in the examples.   

 

I've been collecting evidence on their syntactic behavior and at this point can offer a few 

descriptive observations.  Unsurprisingly component part locative phrases can be coordinated 

with each other (37a).  This is not helpful in determining the syntactic category, though, since we 

would expect that any like categories (i.e. both prepositions phrases and noun phrases) could be 

 

102 

coordinated with each other. Perhaps eventually more useful is that the objects of component 

part locatives can be coordinated with each other (37b).

  A final observation is that component part locatives can appear with the clitic =ca 'also' (38). 

However, we don't yet know enough about this clitic to know whether we can use it as a 

diagnostic for syntactic status.  

 
face=also   

and  
'and also before Juan Perez, governor'

placement of clitics may eventually shed light on the syntactic status of component part locatives 

in CVZ.  Without negative evidence, however, argumentation will be difficult. 

 

2.12.  Co-occurrence, lexicalization, and incorporation of loh 

Component part terms can be found co-occurring with other words in TVZ, including verbs 

(§2.12.1), nouns (§2.12.2), adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions  (§2.12.3). While loh 'face' is 

 

103 

 

not the only component part term that functions in this way, it occurs very frequently in such 

lexicalized environments.  In the following sections I give examples of loh co-occurring with or 

being incorporated into various other types of words.  A precise analysis of the status of loh in 

these words is for future research.  Finally, in §2.12.4, I address the question of once such 

putative co-occurrence of loh, namely in the word for 'first', and argue that there is not enough 

evidence in modern TVZ to support concluding that loh is part of the word for 'first'. 

 

2.12.1. Verbs 

In SLQZ there are many verbs that appear to have the word loh 'face' incorporated into them.  

Here I am only considering instances where loh functions morphologically as part of the verb.  

There are also many instances where loh co-occurs with a verb as a separate word.  For 

discussion of these instances, see §3.8. 

 

The verbs presented in Table 4 share the feature that the verbs with loh all correspond to 

verbs without loh and the presence of loh adds the meaning of 'face' or 'head', although some of 

the meanings are more compositionally opaque than others.

Table 4.  SLQZ verbs containing loh, with meaning 'head' or 'face' 

 
There is evidence that a word meaning 'appear' in CVZ also contained loh.  In the examples in 

(39) the form lao appears in both verbs meaning 'appear'.  In addition, the locative lao occurs 

 

104 

before the individuals the subject is appearing before.  That is to say, in this construction there is 

both a lao in the verb 'appear' and a lao apparently meaning 'before'.

Munro (p.c.) has found that some verbs that end in loh 'face' undergo different phonological 

changes when inflected than other verbs also ending in loh 'face'.  Future work using data such as 

these may shed like on the status of loh within these verbs and perhaps the different phonological 

behavior will be shown to correspond to some different level of incorporation of loh.

Table 7.  SLQZ nouns with loh (data from Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) 

 
There is evidence from CVZ that some of these forms were used in Colonial times.  In the 

following example we what appears to be a cognate to lohguìi'x 'pasture' (cf. (42a)).

pasture=and 

'You shouldn't do as the as animals (do), you should not sinfully meet (i.e. fornicate with) 
your spouse in the mountains and / or in the pasture' 

 

We have no examples of loh nyààa' or loh zhihah 'field' in our CVZ documents, but other words 

for 'field' and 'land' in the dictionary (Córdova 1578b) appear with what may be loh at the 

beginning.

d.  layòo 'land' (CVZ; Córdova 1578b:401v) 
 

 
 

 

I found one instance of 'market' in the Colonial documents, and it appeared without loh (43a), 

although the dictionary entry gives forms both with and without loh (43b).

 b.  quíya, lòoquija  'market' (CVZ; Cordova 1578b:265v) 

There are Colonial examples of 'pueblo' occurring both with (44) and without (45) loh.  It 

may be relevant that (44b) and (44c) appear as part of compounds which mean 'people of this 

town' or 'natives of this town'.

Every instance of bcùùu' 'altar' in the Colonial documents co-occurs with loh 'face', e.g. (46), 

although (47) suggests that this might indeed be co-occurrence and not incorporation, since a 

quantifier intervenes between loh and bcùùu'.

Many  n[ouns]  that  refer  to  locations  begin  with  loh  or  can  be  used  with  or  without  initial  loh 
(usage varies considerably between speakers). Sometimes (though not always) the form with loh 
has a more specifically locational reference than the form without loh {Zagrùu nàa' bcùùu' "The 
altar  is  pretty";  Zagrùu  nàa  loh  bcùùu'  "The  altar  is  pretty,  What's  on  the  altar  is  pretty"}. 
Sometimes loh can never be dropped from these nouns. Sometimes loh drops only in the plural 
{loh nyààa' "field"; ra nyààa', ra loh nyààa' "fields"} or in certain other forms. An extra locative 
loh preposition is never used with these words,  which confirms the idea that they do ultimately 
refer to a location. 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:154; Spanish omitted, italics added 

 

In addition to the nouns presented above, there are place names that begin with loh in SLQZ, 

for example:  

48. a.  Loh Gu'uhzhy Ygwìa 'La Ciénega Zimatlán' (SLQZ; ML:155) 

b.  Loh Gyiahr Zihny (name of a place near San Lucas) (SLQZ; ML:155) 
c.  Loh Gyu'uhzh (name of a place) (SLQZ; ML:155) 
d.  Loh Rra'i (name of a place) (SLQZ; ML:155) 
 
  

2.12.3.  Adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions 

There are adjectives in SLQZ that contain loh.  All of these seem related in meaning to 'face' 

or 'eyes'. 

loh po'op  big-cheeked, with big cheeks (adj.) {… mnìi'iny loh po'op "child with big cheeks"}  
… 
lohar bi'ich  blue-eyed, green-eyed {… bùunny lohar bi'ich "green-eyed person"}… 
lohar bi'ich-bi'ichta'  very blue-eyed, very green-eyed {… bùunny lohar bi'ich-bi'ichta' mnnaàa' 

lohni' "I saw the very green-eyed person"}… 

lohar ngwahd  crosseyed {… lia lohar ngwahd "crosseyed girl"} … 
… 
lohca'ài  nearly blind {attr. only; bùunny lohca'ài "nearly blind person"} … 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:155-156; Spanish omitted, italics added 

 
 

The adverb lohbih, which contains loh and bihih 'air' is identified as a adverb in the SLQZ 

dictionary.   

lohbih  in the air (not moving) (adv.) {Lohbih zèi'byih "It's hanging in the air"} > bihih 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:155; Spanish omitted, italics added 

 
  Finally, loh x:cahll seems to be a complex preposition containing loh. 

 

110 

 

 

 

loh x:cahll  through, because of {used with following adj[ective] plus p[o]ss[esso]r; Loh x:cahll 

milàagr Dyooz bìe'd Cria'st loh gax:lyuh "Through God's miraculousness Christ came to 
earth"; Loh x:cahll nto'onnëng gunyi'tyëng x:mu'ullyëng "Through his stupidity he went and 
lost his money"} 

Munro and Lopez, in prep.:130;  Spanish omitted, italics added 

2.12.4.  Is loh part of 'first'? 

MacLaury (1989) suggests that the word for 'first' also contains 'face'. 5 
 

Regarding body-part terms,  Ayoquesco  Zapotec comes closest to Trique usage  with gçlõ 'first, 
which  combines  the  symbolic  syllable  of  'down',  ga,  with  'face',  lõ.    Anything  that  is  first  is 
lowest, as items are piled or as they were numbered by [the] pre-Columbian notation of ascending 
bars and dots.  

footnote in MacLaury 1989: 151-152 

 
 

Indeed the both the Colonial forms (49) – (50) and the modern forms (51) seem to have 'face' 

in them at first glance.

5 Thanks to Joe Benton for pointing MacLaury's etymology out to me. 
6 The absence of a first person subject here appears to be an instance of the covert subject construction 
(Avelino et al. 2004). 

 

111 

  However, MacLaury's etymology seems problematic for modern TVZ forms. While SLQZ 

'first' might appear to contain 'face' (51a), it does not obviously contain 'down' (51b).  Munro 

 

(p.c.) suggests that the y in yloh is the irrealis aspect prefix. 

51. a.  yloh 'first' (SLQZ; ML:367)  

 

b.  gue'et 'down' (SLQZ; ML:124)  

 
 
Thus, I feel the etymology of TVZ 'first' is unresolved at this point.

Component Part Prepositions: Meaning and Use 

This chapter presents a description and analysis of the meaning and use of component part 

prepositions in Tlacolula Valley Zapotec.  In §3.1 I present a preliminary description of the 

meaning of locative component part prepositions. In §3.2, I define inherent and relative 

component parts, which will provide an important foundation for the rest of the chapter.  In the 

following three sections, I then address other aspects relevant to the semantic behavior of these 

prepositions: the relationship between the prepositions and the search domain (§3.3), frames of 

reference (§3.4), and Viewpoint (§3.5).  Then, in light of these semantic characteristics, I return 

to the characterization of the meaning of the locative component part prepositions in §3.6.    

 

In §3.7 I discuss the use of component part terms in directional constructions and in §3.8, I 

describe and analyze the non-locative meanings of loh 'face'.  

 

In §3.9, I present data on child language acquisition of component part terms in TVZ and 

finally, in §3.10, I propose a path of semantic change and syntactic reanalysis to account for the 

patterns presented throughout this chapter. 

 

Throughout these sections I provide data from TVZ, both narrative data and elicited data, and 

from Colonial Valley Zapotec. 

 

3.1.  The locative meaning of component part prepositions, preliminary 

In this section, I provide examples (where possible, textual) of the locative uses of the 

component part prepositions, along with the SLQZ dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) 

entries of these words in order to give the reader a feel for the range of meanings they have.    

 

The description of the modern meaning of these words is supplemented by examples of their 

use in Colonial Valley Zapotec.  As discussed in §1.1.5, the orthographic conventions used in the 

Colonial documents are not consistent.  What we believe is one word is often spelled many 

different ways.  For example, cognates to the modern TVZ loh 'face' appear in our CVZ 

documents n a number of different ways, including lloo, lo, lao, and loo.  It is not clear in general 

how CVZ spelling corresponds with CVZ pronunciation. When referring in general to the CVZ 

cognates of any TVZ word I will just use the modern form, e.g. in this case loh.  And when 

referring to a specific instantiation in a document, I will use the CVZ spelling used in that 

instance.  Finally, when glossing the CVZ, I will gloss the component part locatives with their 

basic component part meaning; e.g. loh as 'face'.  I intend this gloss to be non-committal as to the 

 
 

116 

 

syntactic category of CVZ loh, which remains an open question, as discussed in §2.11.  I include 

examples of both referential and locative meanings in the Colonial Valley Zapotec.  The lack of 

referential, locative, or both types of meaning means that I have not yet found such a token in my 

corpus.   

 

I intentionally include no directional or non-locative examples in this section, as these are 

discussed in §3.7 and §3.8 respectively.  This section is meant as a starting point for the 

discussion of the meaning of these terms, which are presented below in alphabetical order.  In 

§3.6 I present a revised analysis of the meanings of each term in light of the discussion presented 

in the intervening sections.   

 

3.1.1.    Cwe'eh 'beside' 

In the following sections I outline the use of cwe'eh as a locative in modern TVZ (§3.1.1.1) and 

Colonial Valley Zapotec (§3.1.1.2). 

 

3.1.1.1.  Locative cwe'eh in modern TVZ 

Cwe'eh, related to the (sometimes) component 'side' (cf. §2.2.1), in its locative sense is usually 

translated into English as 'beside' (1a) or 'at the side of' (1b), although there are times where these 

might not seem like natural English, as in (1b).

In the SLQZ dictionary (Munro and Lopez in prep.) the meaning of "in front of (an 

inan[imate] obj[ect] without a clearly defined back and front)" is also given (94), as seen in the 

full dictionary definition below.

side (of anim[ate]) 

…  §§ Many speakers do not agree that  cwe'eh can mean "side" of an animate being (4). Some 

accept this meaning, however.

3.1.1.2.  Locative cwe'eh in CVZ 

Cwe'eh also appears in the Colonial documents, usually spelled as cue.  It is not entirely clear 

from the definition in Córdova's dictionary if cue was used as a body or component part in the 

Colonial era; it is defined as "lado derecho or siniestro [right or left side]" (Córdova 

1578b:238v), and it is not included in the list of body parts in the grammar (Córdova 1578a:199-

201).  Given that there is variation among modern TVZ languages and among speakers as to 

whether cwe'eh 'side' can be used as a body or component part (§2.2.1), it will be interesting to 

continue to pursue its status in the Colonial documents as we continue this research.  In the 

documents we see apparent locative uses of cue, as in (2) below were it is used to delimit a plot 

of land, referring to the east side, the west side, and the side toward Oaxaca City.

1 Although the Zapotec verb appears in the perfective aspect I have translated the verb using an English 
present tense.  Throughout the CVZ documents, we see verbs used to describe the location of land in the 
perfective aspect.  I don't know why this should be the case.  Perhaps the perfective aspect is due to the

3.1.3.    Guë'ëhcy 'on' 

The locative meanings of guë'ëhcy in TVZ are described in 3.1.3.1.  The use of guë'ëhcy in CVZ 

is described in §3.1.3.2. 

 

 

 

                                                                                                                                                            
fact that the land was walked out and measured before the writing of these documents, and that that 
action, is in fact completed.  If this is the case, perhaps a more faithful translation would be "(At the time 
of the measuring) [the land] adjoined the marker on the side [where] the sun rises…'.  However, since it is 
presumable the case that at the time of the writing of these documents, these locational facts were still 
true, the use of perfective aspect is still not wholly clear.

3.1.3.1.  Locative guë'ëhcy in modern TVZ 

Guë'ëhcy, related to the component part 'head', is often used to mean 'on top of' or 'at the top of',

3.1.3.2.  Referential and locative guë'ëhcy in CZV 

Guë'ëhcy appears in the Colonial documents most commonly as queque, which is defined  by 

Córdova as "cabeça generalmente [head, in general]" (1578b: 63). I found no instances of queque 

'head' being used to refer to a human head in the documents.  The referential uses in the 

documents seem to be metaphorical extensions from the body part, as in both (5a) and (5b), 

 
 

120 

where 'head' is used to refer to the head of a town, perhaps a larger political organizational unit.2  

In (5b) a shorter form, que, is used instead of queque.  Que may be another form for 'head' or 

there may have been some haplology occurring in this case, because of the phonetic similarity of 

the following syllable.

3.1.4.  Làa'any 'in' 

 

'another planted field crosses the top of the land of Don Juan Perez' 

In §3.1.4.1 I present the locative meanings of làa'any in modern TVZ and in §3.1.4.2 I present 

the locative meanings of làa'any in Colonial Valley Zapotec. 

 

3.1.4.1.  Locative làa'any in modern TVZ 

Làa'any, related to the component part term 'stomach', is used to mean containment 'in' in the 

sense of contained within, as can be seen in (7a) and (7b). 

                                                 
2 Kevin Terraciano (p.c.) has suggested that the expression que(que) queche might be analyzed as 'the 
head town', referring to the cabecera.  He notes that Nahuatl and Mixtec developed similar terminology 
involving the words for head and town to refer to the new colonial designation of a cabecera.  However, 
this would require a structure in which the modifier precedes the head, which is unusual for head initial 
languages.

In a few cases, làa'any seems better translated with English 'under', as in (8).  However, 

given that làa'any cannot mean 'under' in general, I suggest that this is because the space 

delineated by the legs of the table is enough to count as containment in TMZ (though not in 

English).

expressed as having happened within a certain time frame, apparently using a metaphor of time 

as a container (cf. Lakoff 1987; Lakoff and Johnson 1980), as far as I can tell much as in the 

English, although I have not pursued the details of this metaphor.

In addition to these meanings, Munro and Lopez, et al. (1999) report a non-containment 

meaning of 'in' in SLQZ (10a).  I tested this use in TMZ as well, by asking my consultant to 

translate the English sentence He sang with a microphone.  I purposely avoided saying in a 

microphone in English, since I did not want to prime him with in.  He volunteered (10b) and 

accepted (10c).  (The fact that he accepted and repeated, but did not volunteer (10c) is indicated 

with the preceding "√".)3  

                                                 
3 It seems tempting to explain (10a) as a calque.  However, I don't think there is enough evidence to make 
that conclusion yet.  When I asked my consultant why we use làa'any in (10b) he said it was because "in

I have no other modern examples of non-containment uses of làa'any; however, I do have 

two Colonial examples, which are discussed below in §3.1.4.2;  (15).  

 

The SLQZ dictionary entry for làa'iny, i.e. làa'any (revised spelling) is quoted below.  All 

locative meanings have been bolded.

Spanish it is cantó en las vocinas, pero en dialecto no hay "en"".  I'm sure I don't completely understand 
all of what he meant to convey to me, but notice that he does give as part of the explanation for using 
làa'any the fact that en is used in Spanish, which again might support the theory that this meaning is a 
calque.  However, I did not elicit this in Spanish.  We were speaking in English and I purposely used the 
word "with", not "in".  Additionally, the Spanish preposition en  can be translated in Zapotec (and 
English) in many ways, depending on the situation, including "in" and "on".  (Note that loh 'on' was 
judged ungrammatical in (10d).)   
  The English sentence He sang into the microphone might also be a source of a calque for làa'any, since 
my consultant also speaks English, but this seems much less likely.  However, I did avoid this sentence to 
elicit the translation, to prevent any priming.  It may be relevant that  my consultant did not use English 
'in' as his explanation for the use of làa'any in (10b).

3.1.4.2.  Locative làa'any in CVZ 

Làa'any is also found in the Colonial documents as a locative, most commonly spelled as lani or 

lanij.  The most common locative meaning attested is 'in', as seen in (11).

as indicated in by the use of lani in (12).

The example in (13) presents an interesting use of lani.  Here it seems to be used meaning 'in 

(the possession of)'.  The Spanish translation of this section reads "ytten beinte pesos que me 

deve Pasqual pere [and twenty pesos that Pascual Peres owes me]".  Thus, while it seems 

unlikely that the twenty pesos are physically inside of Pascual Peres it could be that they pesos 

 
 

124 

 

are in Pascual Peres's house, and the Zapotec is employing metonymy by referring to Pascual 

Peres when meaning his house.  Or it may be the case that the phrase lanij Pascual Peres 

actually meant 'in Pascual Peres's house' at that time (it does not seem to have that meaning 

now), and that the component part locative lanij was perhaps similar to the French preposition 

chez in this regard (cf. Longobardi 2001).

Lani occurs in a complex expression laane-yo, which apparently literally means 'in the 

house,' but is used simply to mean 'in.'  The use of this word in modern SLQZ is restricted to 

inside buildings: "la'nyu'uh …  inside, in… used only before certain nouns referring to buildings, 

such as liihahz 'house' and scweel 'school'" (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999: 146).  In the Colonial 

example below, it is used to express 'in the month of October'.

  As mentioned above in §3.1.4.1, there is a Colonial example of the use of làa'any in a 

 

 

beo  

context where it may not have a meaning of 'in' in the sense of containment.  There are two such 

examples where làa'any is used to express "on" in "on the cross" (15); these examples are almost 

identical, and are both from the same pueblo, but are separated in time by 28 years.

3.1.5.  Loh 'in front of; on' 

The locative meanings of loh in modern TVZ are presented in §3.1.5.1, and both the referential 

and locative meanings of loh in CVZ are presented in some depth in §3.1.5.2. 

 

 
 

126 

 

3.1.5.1.  Locative loh in modern TVZ 

Loh, related to the component part 'face', has three locative meanings: 'in front of', 'on' and 

'above'.  It also has many non-locative meanings, which are discussed in §3.8.  An example of 

loh meaning 'in front of' can be seen in (17).

Loh can have both a meaning of "gravitational 'on'" and "adhesional 'on'".  I use 

"gravitational 'on'" to describe situations where the Ground is providing support to the Figure 

through gravity.  Note that in English we could say the tablecloth is on the table and in a sense, it 

is also true that the table is under the table cloth.  For gravitational 'on', then, we have the pattern 

that the Figure is on the Ground and the Ground is under the Figure.  This contrasts with 

adhesional 'on', as we'll see below.  Examples of loh with a gravitational 'on' sense can be seen in 

(18a) and (18b).

Zapotec also uses loh to describe some cases of  adhesional 'on' (19).  In these cases the 

Figure is in contact with the Ground, but the support comes from some type of adhesion, such as 

glue or possibly screws in the case of the telephone and the wall in Figure 2, and not from 

gravity.  Also note here that while in English we could say the telephone is on the wall there is 

no sense in which the wall is under the telephone.  So unlike gravitational 'on', with adhesional 

'on' while the Figure is on the Ground, the Ground is not under the Figure.

Finally, loh can mean 'above' or 'over' as in (20) which was volunteered by my consultant as 

a way to describe Figure 4.

  Out of context, a sentence may be ambiguous between these multiple locative meanings, as 

shown in the example from SLQZ (21) where loh can be interpreted as either 'in front of' or 'on'.

  Below is the dictionary entry for lohoh in SLQZ (Munro and Lopez in prep.).  In addition to 

the meanings I have already discussed, this entry provides examples of lohoh translated as 'in' 

and 'inside', as meanings (5) and (8).  The first example given in (5) and all the examples in (8) 

do not seem locational, so I  discuss these in §3.8.   

 

The second example in (5) does seem locational.  Loh usually cannot mean in, especially in 

any sense of containment.  Perhaps this sentence is an example of one of the uses of the 

adhesional 'on' meaning of loh, which is best translated into English as 'in'.

  §§ Gue'ehcy, lohoh, and pu'ann can all mean "on, on top of". Pu'ann has the special sense of "at 

the very top of", while lohoh can mean "around the top of". Gue'ehcy is most neutral. 

  … §§ Lohoh is pronounced in the phr. form loh in almost all syntactic contexts. 
  §§ Lohoh 2 is usually interpreted as meaning "in front of " when the obj. has an obvious front 

side; otherwise, it means "on top of ".  

  §§ Lohoh 2 is never used to express a location with a noun that begins with loh. See note at loh.

3.1.5.2.  Referential and locative loh in CVZ 

Loh occurs very frequently in the Colonial documents, spelled as lloo, lao, lo, and loo. Loh 

occurs three times more often than any other component part term in these texts (Lillehaugen 

2003). It also seems to have the broadest range of meaning, including the referential (3.1.5.2.1) 

and locative meanings (3.1.5.2.2) presented here and the non-locative meanings presented in 

§3.8. 

3.1.5.2.1.  Referential loh in CVZ 

  Córdova defines láo as "cara o rostro de animal [face (of a person) or face of an animal]" 

(1578a: 72) (22a).  We have seen one example in the Colonial documents of loh referring to an 

physical body part, namely as part of the compound for 'eye' in (22b).  The referential body part 

meaning seems to be the basic meaning for the word, and the thus these are examples of loh 

deriving meaning through direct reference.

In addition, there is an example of loh meaning 'face' in a more complex phrase (23).  Here 

the component part meaning of 'face' derived through direct reference, but the meaning of the 

phrase as a whole is derived through metaphor.

(24) shows loh being used to refer to a component parts of an inanimate, namely a house.  

This meaning is derived through metaphor, by projecting human or animal body parts onto 

inanimates.

  A further type of metaphor is used in the meaning of loh in the examples in (25).  

                                                 
4 Thanks to Natalie Operstein, p.c. for suggesting the identity of this morpheme to me.   
5 Another possible interpretation of this passage involves incorporation of lao into the verb (a).  This is 
perhaps supported by Córdova's entry: tòhuilàoa 'arrostrar a hazer algo [to face (something) to do 
something]' (1578b:40). 
a.  huanee  tiopa    yocho    tobij    n-ohuij-lao=nij

pizaa (CVZ; Ti642;21)

This meaning can be accounted for through a "projecting space" metaphor (Hollenbach 1995).  

First, through metaphorical assignment of anthropomorphic component parts, the flat sides of the 

boundary marker become lao pizaa 'face of the border marker'.  Then, the area projecting from 

that space comes to be referred to by the same name via metonymy.  Thus, the lines projecting 

from the face of the border markers (e.g. one such line is indicated with a white arrow in Figure 

5) are the boundaries.

Another meaning of CVZ loh is "aspect, facet" (26).  This meaning could be derived though 

metaphor in the following way: the original meaning of loh is face, which could come to mean a 

physical surface that you interact with (as we know loh me'es means 'table top').  This meaning 

of a physical surface one interacts with could come to mean a more abstract thing one interacts 

with, thus an "aspect" or "facet" of something.

  As in modern TVZ, CVZ loh can meen 'on' (29).  This meaning can be derived from the 

basic meaning of 'face' in the following way: first there is a metaphorical assignment of the body 

part face to inanimates, such as 'land' (29a) or a table, as in the modern loh me'es 'table top'.   

Then the projecting space metaphor can be used to locate a Figure in the area of space projecting 

from the Ground's 'face'.  When the flat surface which has metaphorically been named 'face' is on 

top, as in the case of the land or the table, then this projecting space metaphor yields the locative 

meaning of 'on'.  

                                                 
8 Those familiar with Zapotec syntax may be surprised by the presence of an independent pronoun 
following a body part.  However, throughout the CVZ documents, the independent form of the pronoun is 
used as an object of loh in cases where the pronoun is followed by an appositive, as here.

There are some cases when CVZ loh seems best translated with English 'in' (30).  While the 

English "on her will" certainly would be an akward translation of (30a), this use of loh is almost 

identical to the use in (29b), and it seems consistent with the meaning described there.  This use 

of loh is also possible in modern TMZ, as indicated in (30b).

làa'any seems to be used for indicating a containment 'in' (§3.1.4), which doesn't seem to be what

In fact làa'any would only be used if the grass was very tall (31c).  However, it is probably more 

likely that CVZ loo guiixi is cognate to modern lohguìi'x 'pasture' which is one of the nouns 

discussed in §2.12 that co-occurs with loh.  

 

I am not sure if loh can be used to say 'on the mountains' in modern TMZ, as a similar, but 

not identical sentence in (31d) is ungrammatical.  It could be that (31a) may be an example of the 

broader locative use of loh in CVZ, which I discuss in §3.8.  

                                                 
9 The lack of an overt subject in this sentence is an instance of the covert subject construction, as 
described in Avelino et al. (2004).

3.1.6.    Nnaàa' 'at the hand of' 

The component part preposition nnaàa', which is related to the body part 'hand', has a very 

limited meaning of 'at the hand of' or 'on the hand of', as illustrated in (32).  ('Hand' in Zapotec 

does not correspond exactly with 'hand' in English.  In Zapotec 'hand' extends all the way from 

the fingertips to the elbow.)

32. Fruat   n-u'uh

'The fruit is in the woman's hands' 
 
This locational meaning is documented for SLQZ in the dictionary (Munro and Lopez in prep.)  

  mnààa'. (SLQZ; CC:L20) 

Note that there is a bit of metaphorical extension in meaning (6): when nnaàa' is used with a 

tree, it means 'on the branch of'.  (Branch in SLQZ is nnaàa' gyahg, where gyahg means 'tree'.) 

 
 

136 

 

nnaàa'  1. hand; arm (of a person) {pssd.}; 2. front paw, front foot, front leg, foreleg, forepaw (of 
a four-legged animal); leg (of an insect or any creature with more than four legs) {pssd.; nnaàa' 
bèe'cw  "the  dog's  front  leg";  nnaàa'  x:matargàa'as  "the  millipede's  leg"};  3.  arm  (of  a  chair) 
{pssd.}; 4. sleeve (of a garment){pssd.; nnaàa' cotoony "the sleeve of the shirt"}; 5. branch (of 
a  tree){pssd.;  Guhch  nnaàa'  gyahg  "The  branch  of  the  tree  broke"};  6.  on  the  branch  of  (a 
tree)  (prep.)  {A  lo'ory  zu'bga'ah  nnaàa'  gyahg  rèe'  "There's  a  parrot  sitting  on  the  branch  of 
this tree"}  

  … §§ Nnaàa' refers generally to the whole arm and hand, though perhaps more specifically to 

the forearm (some speakers use baar nnaàa' "forearm"). Zh:àa'cw means "upper arm".

3.1.7.    Ni'ih 'under' 

In the following sections I describe the locative use of ni'ih in modern TVZ (§3.1.7.1) and the 

use of ni'ih in CVZ (§3.1.7.2). 

 

3.1.7.1.  Locative ni'ih in modern TVZ 

Ni'ih, which means 'foot' or 'leg' as a noun, most commonly means 'under' as a locative (33). 

ni'ih   zhìi'mmy. (TMZ; 3:126) 
under   basket 

33. Bra'au  n-u'uh   
 
lizard   NEU-is   
 
'The lizard is under the basket' 
 
It can also mean 'at the foot of' as in (34a).   (34b) provides another example which is much 

easier to translate into English: here ni'ih can to mean 'at the bottom of' a document.

10 This sentence is felicitous as long as the cat is on the ground, outside the house, fairly near the house (it 
can be touching the house, but it cannot be very far away from the house), and not under the house.

The SLQZ dictionary entry for ni'ih is below: 

ni'ih  1. foot; leg (of a person, bird, or piece of furniture) {tu ni'ih? "whose foot?"; ni' bùunny "a 
person's foot"; ni' me'es "the leg of the table"}; 2. back paw, hind paw, back leg, hind leg (of a 
four-legged animal) {ni' bèe'cw "the dog's back legs"}; 3. handle (on a knife, for example) {ni' 
bchiilly "knife handle"}; 4. hem, bottom edge (of clothing); lower part {ni' cotoony "hem of a 
shirt";  Ryuhnny  guèèe'b  ni'  yu'uh  "Acahual  gets  fastened  to  the  lower  part  of  the  house"};  5. 
under (prep.) {ni' yu'uh "under the house"; Zàa'ng ni'ih gyahg "He walks under the trees"}  

… 
  §§  Ni'ih refers to the  whole leg and  foot,  and perhaps more specifically to the lower leg and 

foot. Cùùu'dy means "thigh". 

Munro and Lopez, in prep.:18; Spanish omitted; italics and some bold added 

 

3.1.7.2.  Referential ni'ih in CVZ 

Córdova defines ni as "pie o mano de animal quadrupede [foot or forefoot of a four-legged 

animal]" (1578b:314) and its appearance as a noun in the document is a metaphorical extension 

of the body part meaning, as in (35) below, where ni refers to the foot of the will.

3.1.8.    Ru'uh 'at the edge of'

use of ru'uh in CVZ. 

 

3.1.8.1.  Locative ru'uh in modern TVZ

3.1.8.2.  Referential and locative ru'uh in CVZ 

Ru'uh is also found in the Colonial Valley Zapotec materials.  It appears commonly as rua, 

which is defined by Córdova as "boca generalmente [mouth, in general]" (1578b: 56v), but all of 

the nominal uses of rua 'mouth' in the documents are metaphorical extensions, as in (39a) and 

(39b) where rua is used to refer to the horizon—the edge of the land.

(CVZ; Co721-3;4-8) 

'[The lot of land] meets the border marker of the solar of the late Sebastian Vicente on the 
east and toward  the west [it] meets the border marker of Pedro Gomez.' 

 
  CVZ ru'uh seems to have the locative meaning 'on the edge of' (40). 
                                                 
11 We believe the border markers referred to in the Colonial documents are probably very similar to 
border markers that can still be seen today in some parts of Oaxaca.  These border markers are usually 
made of stones and can range from a smaller small pile of stones or one large stone, to a large, possibly 
ornate tower of stones and mortar.  An example of one can be seen in Figure 5, on page 132.

3.1.10.  Zh:àa' 'behind; under' 

The component part preposition zh:àa' is related to the limited component part zh:àa' 'buttocks'

something more like 'at the buttocks of'.  The entry in the SLQZ dictionary (Munro and Lopez in 

prep.) gives further examples of these locative meanings, in addition to the locative meaning "on 

top of (something upside down)", which can also be described as 'at the buttocks of'. 

zh:àa'    1.  bottom,  buttocks  {pssd.  only;  A  bu'uhdy  zubga'ah  gue'ehcy  zh:àa'  zhìi'mmy  "The

… 
  §§  Although  zh:àa'  and  zh:ààa'n  both  mean  "bottom,  buttocks",  the  use  of  zh:àa'  is  more 
restricted.  This  word  is  almost  never  used  without  a  n[oun]  (non-pron[ominal])  pssr. 
[possessor], and  may suggest  a dirty bottom {zh:àa'  mnìi'iny "kid's bottom";  zh:àa'  banguual 
"old person's bottom (that someone in a nursing home might have to clean up)"}; zh:ààa'n is a 
more general term.

142 

3.1.11.1. Locative zh:ààa'n in modern TVZ 

Like zh:àa', the component part preposition zh:ààa'n (related to 'buttocks) is often translated as 

'behind' (43a) or 'under' (43b), and is perhaps best understood as meaning 'at the buttocks of'.

zh:ààa'n  1. bottom, buttocks, rear end {pssd. only; zh:àa'nùu' "your bottom"}; 2. under (prep.)

3.1.12. Zh:ùu'cw 'at the upper arm of' 

As with nnaàa', the component part preposition zh:ùu'cw (TMZ) (or zh:àa'cw in SLQZ) has a 

very limited meaning: 'at the upper arm of'.  This locative is related to the referential noun 

meaning 'upper arm'.  The entry from the SLQZ dictionary (Munro and Lopez in prep.) attests to 

this meaning in SLQZ, and its locative use with a tree as a Ground in definition (4). 

zh:àa'cw  1. upper arm {pssd. only; zh:àa'cwa' "my upper arm"}; 2. upper part of the front leg 
(of  a  four-legged  animal);    3.  branch  (of  a  tree)  {zh:àa'cw  gyahg  "the  branch  of  the  tree"; 
Guhch nnaàa' gyahg "The branch of the tree broke"}; 4. on the branch of (a tree) (prep.) {A

3.2. 

Inherent and relative component parts 

Throughout this dissertation, I use the term "component part" to mean a word that is either a 

body part term (such as English head, foot, stomach) and / or a term for a component part of an 

inanimate object (such as top, underside).  It is important to be able to discuss precisely how 

referential component parts are assigned and named, because the meaning of referential 

component parts may contribute to the meaning of component part locatives, and the meanings 

of referential component parts and component part locatives may interact in complex ways.  It is 

essential, then, to carefully distinguish the different uses and meanings of component part terms.  

For example, in TVZ words for component parts can refer to parts of an item (45a); refer to areas 

of space12 (projecting from parts of an item; cf. Hollenbach 1995) (45b); or assert locative 

relationships between two items (45c). 

                                                 
12 This characteristic is not limited to component part prepositions.  Native non-component part 
prepositions (a, b, c) and borrowed prepositions (d) can be used to refer to areas of projecting space.  (The 
verb 'be' is used to express 'hurt', as seen in these examples.)

may not be.  In order to understand how and why the component part locatives mean what they 

do, it is important to understand and isolate their referential meanings.  When establishing the 

status and meaning of referential component parts, it is essential to present them in non-locative 

sentences, ideally in an unambiguously nominal syntactic frame, in order to avoid circularity.  

There may be various language specific ways to do this.  In TVZ the following seem to be clear 

nominal syntactic frames: if the word is proceded by a quantifier (cf. §2.7.2), number (cf. 

§2.7.3), or plural marker (cf. §2.7.1); modified by an adjective (cf. §2.7.4), or in the object 

position of a transitive verb subcategorized for an NP complement, as in (48).   

 

In investigating the meaning of component parts, it is useful to distinguish between what I 

call inherent and relative component parts.  I define these terms below.  In any language, the 

status of a particular component part as inherent or relative is empirically discoverable and

term and testing its use in referring to a component part of an item under rotation, as described 

below. 

  An inherent component part refers to a specific subpart of an object, based on features of the 

object itself, such as its geography or asymmetrical features, but importantly not based on the 

object's current orientation in space. My term inherent component part does not coincide exactly 

with Levinson's (e.g. 2003) term "inherent features".  For discussion of this, see §3.2.1.   

  A relative component part, on the other hand, is assigned to an object based on the way it is 

located in space and in relation to its observers.  Relative component parts can be seen, in a way, 

as temporary names for sub-parts of an object based on factors exterior to the object itself.    

  One can get an initial sense of the distinction by considering the English examples in (46).  In 

(46a) top in an inherent component part.   The same physical part of the jewelry box could be 

referred to with the expression top of the jewelry box in (46a) regardless of the orientation of the 

jewelry box.  Even if the jewelry box were upside down (46a) would be felicitous to describe the 

then bottom-most part.  Top of the ball (46b) works quite differently, however.  This is a relative 

component part in English (as in most—maybe all languages, because of the real world, physical 

structure of a ball).  Its real world referent must be calculated based on the ball's current 

orientation in space. 

46. a.   The top of the jewelry box is cracked 
 
 
 

b.  The top of the ball is dark. 

 

   

(top = inherent component part) 
(top = relative component part) 

This same distinction is found in TVZ.  In (47a) guë'ëhcy 'head' is an inherent component 

part. Regardless of the orientation of a person, his head is always referred to as guë'ëhcy bìiny 

'the person's head'. Thus, when referring to people, guë'ëhcy 'head' is an inherent component part. 

The fact that the person's head is referred to as guë'ëhcy 'head' has to do with the person's 

structure, and not the orientation of the person, or the perspective of the observer. However, 

 
 

146 

 

when referring to a ball in TVZ, guë'ëhcy 'head' is a relative component part (47a). Unlike a 

person, a ball has no inherent guë'ëhcy 'head'.  At any point in time, a ball can be assigned a 

guë'ëhcy 'head', namely the part that is topmost given (most likely) the perspective of the viewer.  

(Although other factors can be used to calculate relative component parts, this perspective of the 

viewer is the most common.)

This should not be too surprising to English speakers, as the possible interpretations of 

 

guë'ëhcy pelo't 'top of the ball' coincide in this way with English top of the ball.  Of course, this 

also seems to make sense from a more physical perspective, in that a ball is symmetrical and thus 

has no distinguishing inherent features that are available to use in assigning an inherent guë'ëhcy 

'head'.  However, it is important to note that I have defined inherent and relative component parts 

as linguistic concepts.  In order to examine how location is expressed linguistically, concepts 

such as inherent and relative component parts should also be investigated through linguistic 

evidence.  This may often coincide with what we think makes sense, given how things are in the 

real world, but since there is cross-linguistic and language internal variation in how inherent and 

relative component parts are assigned, there may also be cases where the linguistic evidence may 

seen to contradict our "intuitions".  So while in many cases the distinction between inherent and 

relative component part may seem to be obvious, in fact this is a language specific distinction.  

The TVZ cases discussed above happened to coincide with English, but in other cases Zapotec is 

divergent from English, as I'll show in §3.2.2 and which will become particularly relevant in 

§3.3.

3.2.1.  Comparison with other terminology 

My terms inherent and relative component part do not correspond directly with other terms used 

to discuss similar ideas in the literature on language and space.  Specifically my term inherent 

component part does not align with Levinson's (2003) inherent features.  While I feel it is 

unfortunate to muddy the waters by not using existing terminology, I present and define my new 

terminology here because I feel that the existing terminology is inadequate for my purposes in 

describing and analyzing component part locatives. In this section I will present the terms used 

by Levinson (2003) that overlap with my terms "inherent component part" and "relative 

component part" and explain how they relate to the terminology I use in this dissertation. 

At first it may seem that Levinson's (2003) term "inherent features" coincides with my term 

"inherent component part".  

Informally, this [the intrinsic] frame of reference involves an object-centred coordinate system, 
where  the  coordinates  are  determined  by  the  'inherent  features',  sidedness  or  facets  of  the 
object to be used as the ground or relatum.   

Levinson 2003:41; bold added 

 

 

Levinson continues the passage above by stating that the term "inherent" may be a bit of a 

misnomer, since languages differ in how these parts are assigned.  As far as languages and 

cultures differ in which part of an object to call the face, or back, or side, I agree with him.  I use 

the term inherent, however, to refer to the component part's relation to the object within that 

system.  So within any linguistic system (and along with whatever mechanisms are used to 

assign the inherent component parts, some of which Levinson discusses below) these component 

parts are inherent to their object.  This "inherency" is linguistically testable, as described above, 

i.e. in order to qualify as an inherent component part, that part should be so named regardless of 

the object's current orientation (or motion, etc.) in space.   

 

 
 

149 

 

The  phrase  'inherent  features',  though  widely  used  in  the  literature,  is  misleading:  such  facets 
have to be conceptually assigned according to some algorithm, or learned on a case-by-case basis, 
or more often a combination of these.  The procedure varies fundamentally across languages, for 
example in English it is largely functional, so that the front of a TV is the side we attend to, while 
the  front  of  a  car  is the  facet  that  canonically  lies  in the  direction  of  motion  etc.    But  in some 
languages, it is much more closely based on shape, as in Tzeltal, where a volumetric analysis … 
is required, and function and canonical orientation is largely irrelevant (Levinson 1994). 

Levinson 2003:41 

 

 

The real point at which my term inherent component part differs from Levinson's intrinsic 

features is illustrated below.  In this passage he is expanding on the idea presented in the 

previous passage: that features (component parts) of an item are assigned to items in culturally 

specific ways—and the methods for making this assignment may be quite varied, including the 

canonical use of the item, how we culturally relate to the item, or direction of motion.   

As  we have seen, in the intrinsic frame of  reference the figure object is located  with respect to 
what are often called intrinsic or inherent features of the ground object.  The locutions are bad, 
because often nothing is 'inherent', and everything is culturally imposed and assigned, in the 
isolation and designation of these features.  Consider, for example, the phrases in front of the TV, 
in front of the steps, in front of the church, in front of the ship, in the front of the book etc (in the 
relevant non-relative or 'non deictic' sense).   Clearly  the  notion  'front'  of  an  object  is  not  an 
inherent property: in the case of the TV it is based on canonical viewing position, in the case 
of the steps on the direction they are ascended (rather than descended), in the case of the church 
the west end regardless of the ordinary entrance, in the case of the book the first few pages, and 
in the case of the ship the direction of canonical movement. 

Levinson 2003:76; bold added 

 
I have two main concerns with Levinson's description of "intrinsic or inherent features" as 

presented here.  One major concern is that all of the examples he gives here are locative.  Of 

course, he is discussing the intrinsic frame of reference, which is calculated based on intrinsic or 

inherent features, and the intrinsic frame of reference does have to do with locating items.  

However, before we can talk about how intrinsic features can be used to locate items in the 

intrinsic frame of reference, we need to know what intrinsic features are, and no such examples 

are given.  We should be looking first at examples of (referential) intrinsic features such as "the 

front of the TV" and "the front of the ship", preferably in clearly referential (and nominal) 

frames.  

 
 

150 

 

  My second concern is that Levinson gives no testable criterion for determining whether a 

feature of an item is an intrinsic feature.  Would the front of a ball in motion be considered an 

intrinsic feature in this system?  Let me take two of his (English) examples and show how I 

would classify these in my system: the front of the TV and the front of a ship.   

 

In English, front can be an inherent component part of a television, namely the screen.  

Consider (49).  If the screen is dirty and it is facing the speaker, of course (49a) is acceptable; 

and if the screen is cracked and it is facing the speaker, (49b) is acceptable.  However, if the 

screen is not facing the speaker, e.g. if the TV is upside down because it is in the process of 

being moved, (49a) and (49b) could both still be acceptable.  This qualifies front as an inherent 

component part of the TV, since it is defined based on the structure of the TV, and not in terms 

of its orientation in space or the perspective of the viewers.   

b.  The front of the TV is cracked. 

49. a.  The front of the TV is dirty. 
 
 
 

It is also possible to assign a relative component part front to a TV in English.  Although 

judgments from English speakers vary, many speakers judge (50) grammatical.  In this case, 

front is defined by the TV's current orientation is space.  Namely the side that is facing away 

from the wall, which we know is not the screen.  However, in order to get a relative component 

part reading for front with a TV, it works best to set up a scenario where the TV either isn't 

working or is being used for some other purpose (or both).  Thus, I think English allows both an 

inherent and relative component part front for a TV, but the default reading is inherent, and in 

order to get the relative reading extra pragmatic information is required.  

50. The television is broken, so we've been using it as a shelf in the corner, with the screen 

facing down to protect it.  My son got into some stickers yesterday and decorated the TV, 
and now the front of the TV is quite colorful!   
 

 
 

151 

 

 

In determining what type of component part in involved in the front of the ship example, I've 

changed "ship" to "boat" in order to better illustrate my point.  If the boat in question is 

symmetrical along the side-to-side axis (i.e. the front and the back are the same), for example a 

simple canoe, then front cannot be an inherent component part.  Consider a symmetrical canoe, 

of which one half is painted red and the other half is painted blue (the halves being divided along 

the relevant side-to-side axis).  In examining the boat out of the water and not in motion, with the 

red part facing the speaker one could say (52).  But if the boat was then rotated 180 degrees, (52) 

would be infelicitous.  With a symmetrical boat, it cannot be the structure of the boat that is 

determining the assignment of front.  It must always be its current orientation in space, direction 

of motion, or some other external factor.  Thus, a symmetrical boat has no inherent component 

part front.  It only has a relative component part front.   

51. The front of the boat is red. 
 
  With an asymmetrical boat, however, it's quite a different story.  The structure of the boat 

itself can assign an inherent front.  Consider a boat that has a figure of a mermaid at the bow.  

Here, even if the boat is not in motion, the part with the mermaid can be referred to as the front. 

Thus, the asymmetry of the item itself allows the assignment of an inherent component part front 

in this case.   

52. The front of the boat looks like a mermaid. 
 
 

Levinson also describes how component parts of objects can be identified using a box-like 

armature.  Let us call such parts "generalized component parts".  I will save the discussion of the 

armature and generalized component part until the introduction of frames of reference in §3.4.3.

3.2.2.    Inherent component parts and metaphor in TVZ 

In Zapotec, many inanimate items have inherent component parts which are assigned via 

metaphor.  In the following two sections I present the inherent component parts of a car 

(§3.2.2.1) and a house (§3.2.2.2) in order to give the reader a feeling of how human body parts 

are metaphorically projected onto inanimates.  The assignment of inherent component parts to 

inanimates will also be relevant for the discussion of types of Grounds and frames of reference in 

§3.4.2.3.    

 

3.2.2.1.  Inherent component parts of a car 

A car in TVZ has inherent component parts that correspond to most (but not all) human body 

parts.  Some common inherent component parts of a car are labeled in Figure 9.  One noticeable 

gap is ni'ih ca'rr 'the foot of the car' which one might think could refer to the wheels of a car, or 

perhaps even the underbelly of the car.  But in TMZ there is no such part of a car called ni'ih 

ca'rr.

  All the parts labeled in Figure 9 were identified as "inherent component parts" using the 

methodology described in the previous section.  For example, the following paradigm shows that 

guë'ëhcy 'head' in an inherent part of the car.  The part of the car that is referred to as guë'ëhcy 

ca'rr is always the same part—the roof, which is circled in Figure 10.  This assignment depends 

on the structure of the car, not the orientation of the car.  As can be seen below, it cannot be the 

case that guë'ëhcy ca'rr means something like 'the topmost part of the car', because if the car is in 

a non-canonical orientation (Figure 11), the topmost part cannot be referred to as guë'ëhcy ca'rr 

(53).  Thus, a car has an inherent guë'ëhcy 'head' and cannot be assigned a relative guë'ëhcy 

'head'.

3.2.2.2. Inherent component parts of a house 

A house functions as a unique type of Ground in locative constructions, and interacts with 

component part prepositions in interesting ways.  Before discussing the semantics of a house as a 

Ground, it is important to understand the geography and composition of a house in TVZ.  Note 

that in TVZ the word yu'uh can refer to either an individual room or the entire house complex, as 

explained for SLQZ below. 

yu'uh, gyu'uh  home (non-pssd.); room (with its own outside door); house: esp., European-style 
house;  building…      §§  Traditional  homes  in  San  Lucas  Quiaviní  include  a  number  of  adobe 
structures  with  common  walls,  each  called  a  yu'uh,  each  with  its  own  exterior  door  (but  no 
connecting  interior  doorways).  The  whole  home  may  be  someone's  liihahz  (e.g.  as  liahz 
Gye'eihlly "Mike's house"), but is generally not called a yu'uh.   

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:369; Spanish omitted, italics added 

 

Figure 12 shows a picture of a more modern house in Tlacolula.  Although the rooms are no 

longer built of adobe, the overall layout of the house is the same as that described in the 

dictionary entry above: each room has one door that leads to outside.  There are no interior 

hallways or doors.  As is also common in my experience, the main living room of the house in 

the picture is the covered area that opens onto the main courtyard of the house.

3.3.  Component part prepositions and the search domain 

One might assume that, since component part locatives (such as the TVZ component part 

prepositions) are related to referential component parts, their meaning as locatives will be related 

to those component parts as well.  One way this is phrased in the literature is in terms of the 

"search domain".  There is often an implicit assumption that all languages with component part 

locative work as described for Tzeltal below: that the component part locative names a part of 

the Ground which is then used to define or narrow a search domain. 

It is cross-linguistically common for locative terms employing the intrinsic frame of reference to 
derive  historically  from  body  part  terms  (Svorou,  1994;  Heine,  1997)...    In  many  languages, 
however,  the  body-part-based  intrinsic  system  is  extremely  complex,  requiring  regular 
linguistically  driven  visual  analysis  of  the  axial  geometry  as  well  as  the  major  and  minor 
protrusions of inanimate objects so that the relative appropriateness of different body part terms 
can  be  computed  instantly  on  the  basis  of  these  inherent  properties,  i.e.,  independent  of  the 
object's orientation or the speaker's viewpoint. Perhaps the best-studied language of this type is 
Tzeltal (Levinson, 1994), in which even a G[round] as seemingly nondescript as a stone may be 
assigned  a  "face,"  a  "nose,"  an  "ear,"  a  "back,"  a  "belly,"  or  any  of  about  fifteen  other 
quasimetaphorical body parts in order to specify that F[igure] is located within a search domain 
projected from one of these facets—e.g., an s-jol "head" is a protrusion that can be found at one 
end of the major axis of G[round] and that has a gently curved, circular outline with only minor 
concavities on either side.   

Kemmerer in press:11; bold added 

 

 
 

157 

In the following sections I examine the potential use of the notion of "search domain" for the 

locative system in TVZ, and conclude that the TVZ system is significantly different from that 

described for Tzeltal above, and further that component part locative systems, therefore, differ in 

 

their use of search domains. 

 

3.3.1.  Semantically infelicitous component part constructions 

Recall that the head initial characteristic of TMZ means that every component part prepositional 

phrase is, out of context, ambiguous with a potential possessed noun phrase, as in (55). 

55.  a.  ni'ih  me'es (TMZ) 
 
 

under  table 
'under the table' 

 
 

 

table 

foot 
'the leg of the table' 

b.  ni'ih   me'es (TMZ) 
 
 

 
 
 
 
In this section I give evidence that not every component part prepositional phrase corresponds to 

an actual possessed noun phrase.  This evidence argues against the assumption that component 

part locatives necessarily function by naming a component part of the Ground, and thus defining 

a search domain. 

For example. although ni'ih 'under' is used in the locative expression in (56a), there is no 

referent ni'ih ca'rr 'the car's foot' (56b), although this is syntactically well formed (hence the # 

indicating semantic infelicity despite syntactic well-formedness).  The speaker I consulted 

rejected the possibility that the wheels or tires might be called ni'ih ca'rr 'the car's feet'; I was 

told that the tires are not ni'ih ca'rr 'the car's feet' (56b), but are ya'annt 'tires' (56c) or rrueed 

'wheels' (56d).  I also found it very interesting that when I asked my consultant to translate ni'ih 

ca'rr out of context he said "abajo del coche [under the car]".  It is my experience that out of 

 
 

158 

context component part words are translated with their referential meaning.  Perhaps this is 

further evidence that in fact there is no physical referent ni'ih ca'rr.    

 

56.  a.  N-u'uh           bèe'ell   

ni'ih     
snake      under   

ca'rr. (TMZ; 5:151)

NEU-be  
'The snake is under the car' 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

b.   ni'ih      
  
foot       
    cannot mean 'the car's foot', 'wheel', or 'tire'; can only mean 'under the car' 

ca'rr  (TMZ; 5:150) 
car 

 

c.  ya'annt  (TMZ; 5:150) 
 

'tire' 

 
 
 
 
 
In this case, ni'ih 'under' cannot be functioning by identifying a component part of the Ground, 

d.  rrueed (TMZ; 5:150) 
 

'wheel' 

since the car has no part that can be referred to as ni'ih ca'rr 'the car's feet'.   

 

3.3.2.  Mismatch between location of Figure and component part of Ground 

In this section, I show that even if the Ground has a component part that could be referred to with 

the component part term used in the locative construction, the Figure does not have to be located 

on or in an area of space projecting from that component part on the Ground in order to use that 

term.  In other words, the locative meaning of the component part preposition does not 

necessarily relate to the referential component part meaning, and the component part preposition 

does not necessarily function by identifying a component part of the Ground, thereby defining a 

search domain.   The data presented here further support the grammaticalization of the meanings 

of component part prepositions in TVZ and show that their meanings cannot be derived through 

synchronic metaphor.   

For example, in (57a) below quiah ca'rr 'the head of the car' refers to the hood of the car in 

SJGZ.  However, the Figure (in this case, a snake) does not need to be located on the hood of the 

 
 

159 

 

car in order to use quiah 'on' in a locative construction.  Example (57b) shows the use of quiah 

'on' in the case where the car is upside-down and a snake is on top of the upside-down car 

(Figure 14).  In this example, we see that the locative expression quiah 'on' can refer to 

relationships between the snake and the car where the snake is not on the hood, even though the 

hood is the referent of the noun phrase quiah ca'rr 'the head of the car'. 

57. a.  quiah  ca'rr  (SJGZ) 
 
 
 

head    car 
'the car's head' (the hood of the car) 

 
 

b.  N-u'uh

NEU-be      snake      on         
car 
'The snake is on the car'; √ Figure 14 

 
 
 

Figure 14.  snake and upside-down car 

 

 

 
Given the scenario in Figure 14, if one tried to use quiah ca'rr to narrow the search domain by 

locating the quiah ca'rr 'the car's head (i.e. the hood)', one would not find the snake! 

 

 Consider the example below from TMZ, which refers to the situation presented in Figure 15, 

in which a child is seated leaning against one of the legs of a table, but is not under the table.  A 

leg of the table can be referred to as 'a foot of the table' (58a).  Although the child is sitting 

against the ni'ih me'es 'leg of the table', (58b), which uses the prepositional phrase ni'ih me'es, is 

ungrammatical when used to describe this relationship.  This is because although as a noun ni'ih 

means 'foot', as a preposition it means 'under', and the child is not under the table in this scenario, 

 
 

160 

although she is sitting against the table's leg.  Both sentences (58c) and (58d) could be used to 

describe this situation, and the preposition used in both of these sentences is cwe'eh 'beside,' 

either in (58c) as 'beside the table's leg' or in (58d) as 'beside the table.'

'The child is sitting beside the table'; √ Figure 15 

 

 

Figure 15.  child and table 

 

  A final example is presented below.  Loh me'es can be a noun phrase 'tabletop (literally the 

face of the table)'.  This component part is an inherent part of the table, i.e. the part of the table 

that is referred to as loh me'es 'tabletop' is based on the composition of the table itself, and it does 

not change depending on which way the table is oriented: the tabletop is the tabletop even if the 

table is upside down!  This is shown below, where (59) can be used to describe the tabletop (i.e. 

the circled part) in Figure 16 where the table is in canonical orientation, and in Figure 17 where 

the table is sideways.

'The tabletop is dirty'; √ Figure 16, √ Figure 17 (if the circled area is dirty) 

 

 
 
 
 

Figure 16.  tabletop I 

Figure 17. tabletop II 

 
 
  Although loh me'es 'tabletop' can refer to the tabletop regardless of the orientation of the 

 

 

table, it cannot refer to the part of the table that is the topmost, unless the table is in canonical 

orientation, as in Figure 16.  Thus although the circled area Figure 18 is the topmost part of the 

table in the picture, loh me'es 'tabletop' cannot be used to describe the area circled, as shown in 

(60). 

60.  Loh   me'es   me'eu.  (TMZ) 

table   dirty 

face  
'The tabletop is dirty'; #Figure 18 

 

 
 

162 

 

Figure 18. topmost part of the table II 

 

 
 

So far, then, I have established that the noun phrase loh me'es 'tabletop' is an inherent 

component part of the table, and that this component part may not be interpreted relatively for a 

table.  Now consider the examples below where the component part prepositions loh 'on' may be 

used to describe the relationship between the dog and the table, even if the dog is not located at 

the 'tabletop'.

  Although there is a noun phrase loh me'es 'the tabletop', the Figure does not need to be 

located at that part of the table when using the component part preposition loh 'on'.  In fact, if the 

 
 

163 

Figure is located by the tabletop, but is not on the table, then the component part preposition loh 

'on' cannot be used, as demonstrated in (62).

3.3.3.  Irrelevance of orientation of Ground 

In the case of the dog and the table presented above, and many other cases, the geography and 

orientation of the Ground is irrelevant to the choice of component part preposition, i.e. the 

preposition is asserting a locative relation in these cases, not identifying a location on the 

Ground.  In these cases, the orientation of the Ground is irrelevant for the choice of preposition.  

(There are certain prepositions and certain Grounds which work differently.  These will be 

discussed in §3.6.)  

  Consider (63), which can describe both Figure 22 and Figure 23.  We can see that ni'ih can 

be used to mean 'under' regardless of the orientation of the car, which is in its canonical 

orientation in Figure 22 and is upside-down in Figure 23.

The choice of preposition is dictated by the relationship between the Figure and the Ground and 

Figure 23.  snake and upside-down car 

not by the geography or orientation of the Ground.  This shows, again, that the notion of a 

prototypical "search domain" cannot be used alone to account for the meaning of the component 

part locatives in TVZ.  Ni'ih in (63) is not locating the snake in relation to the car by finding the 

ni'ih of the car—instead it requires that the snake be under the car. 

 

3.4. 

Frames of reference 

A spatial array may often be described in more than one way.  Consider the English examples 

(64a) – (64c), which can all be used to describe the location of the woman in relation to the car in 

Figure 24.  (Even (64d) is true, although unlikely to be used by many speakers.) 

 
 

165 

64. a.  The woman is in front of the car. 
 
 
 

b.  The woman is beside the car. 
c.  The woman is to the right of the car. 
d.  The woman is to the north of the car. 

 

 

 N 

Figure 24.  woman and car 

 

 
 

So how can the woman be thought of as being both in front of  and beside the car?  Levinson 

(2003) has dealt with these issues in defining three frames of reference that are used in 

describing spatial arrays in the world's languages: intrinsic, relative, and absolute.  In §3.4.1 I 

explain Levinson's (2003) frames of reference.  In §3.4.2 I show how the different frames of 

reference are used in TVZ.  Based on data from TMZ, in §3.4.3 I revisit the definition of the 

intrinsic Frame of Reference.  In the final two sub-sections I show how choice of frame of 

reference can be determined by the type of Ground (§3.4.2.3) and by the preposition itself. 

 

3.4.1.    Defining the frames of reference 

In §3.4.1.1 I present the intrinsic frame of reference and in §3.4.1.2 I present the relative frame 

of reference.  Finally, the absolute frame of reference will be briefly discussed in §3.4.1.3.  I 

summarize these three frames of reference by comparing their definitional facts under rotation in 

§3.4.1.4. 

 

 
 

166 

 

3.4.1.1.  Intrinsic frame of reference 

In Levinson's intrinsic frame of reference the Figure is located on or in an area of space 

projecting from some component part of the Ground.  The exact nature of the component part 

involved will be discussed further in §3.4.3.  Levinson defines the intrinsic frame of reference as 

follows: 

Informally, this [the intrinsic] frame of reference involves an object-centred coordinate system, 
where the coordinates are determined by the 'inherent features', sidedness or facets of the object 
to be used as the ground or relatum… 
More exactly: an intrinsic spatial relator R is a binary spatial relation, with arguments F[igure] 
and G[round], where R typically names a part of G.  The origin X of the coordinate system C is 
always on the volumetric centre of G.  An intrinsic relation R(F,G) asserts that F lies in a search 
domain extending from G on the basis of an angle or line projected from the centre of G, through 
an anchor point A (usually the named facet 'R'), outwards for a determined distance.  F and G 
may be any objects whatsoever (including ego), and F may be a part of G.  The relation R does 
not support transitive inferences, nor converse inferences.  

Levinson 2003:41 - 42; bold added   

 

The use of (64a) to describe Figure 24 is an example of the use of the intrinsic frame of reference 

in English.   

  Using Levinson's more precise definition above, we can see that for (64a), in front of 

(woman, car) asserts that the woman lies in a search domain extending from the car on the basis 

of a line projecting from the center of the car, through the component part named 'front of the 

car', outwards for some distance, as shown below in Figure 25. 

 

 
 

front of car

3.4.1.2.  Relative frame of reference 

In the relative frame of reference the Figure in located in reference to the Ground using 

coordinates imposed by a Viewpoint.  This Viewpoint usually corresponds with the viewer, 

although the Viewpoint can be shifted in the right circumstances.  The use of (64b) and (64c) to 

describe Figure 24 are examples of the use of the relative frame of reference in English, which is 

schematized below in Figure 26. 

 

 

Viewpoint 

 

Figure 26.  woman beside car (relative frame of reference) 

3.4.1.3.  Absolute frame of reference 

The absolute frame of reference makes use of fixed points in the real world to relate a Figure to a 

Ground.  Often these points correspond with cardinal directions, but that is not the only possible 

manifestation of an absolute frame of reference, as can be seen in the definition from Levinson 

below.  The English example in (64d) above is an example of the use of the absolute frame of 

reference in English. 

 

 
 

168 

 

…  many  languages  make  extensive,  some  almost  exclusive,  use  of  such  an  absolute  frame  of 
reference on the horizontal.  They do so by fixing arbitrary fixed bearings, 'cardinal directions', 
corresponding  one  way  or  another  to  directions  or  arcs  that  can  be  related  by  the  analyst  to 
compass bearings… 
  More  precisely:  An  absolute  relator  R  expresses  a  binary  relation  between  F[igure]  and 
G[round], asserting that F can be found in a search domain at the fixed bearing R from G.  The 
origin  X  of  the  coordinate  system  is  nearly  always  centred  on  G...  and  the  system  of  terms 
anchored by reference to a conceptual 'Slope' S.  G may be any object whatsoever, including ego 
or  another  deictic  centre;  F  may  be  a  part  of  G.    The  geometry  of  the  coordinate  system  is 
linguistically / culturally variable, so that in some systems equal quadrants of 90 degrees may be 
projected from G, while in others something more like 45 degrees may hold for arcs on one axis, 
and perhaps 135 degrees on the other.  The literature also reports abstract systems based on star-
setting points and winds, which will then tend to have uneven distribution around the horizon. 

Levinson 2003:49 

 

3.4.1.4.  Definitional facts under rotation 

Levinson (2003) also provides definitional criteria for the frames of reference based on truth 

conditions of a locative construction when various elements in the spatial array are rotated.  

These criteria, which I'll refer to as the definitional facts under rotation, are summarized in Table 

2.  The first column represents the starting configuration for a spatial array (the same one we saw 

in Figure 24) and three possible descriptions (using three different Frams of Reference) for this 

arrangement.  The following three columns each show the rotation of one element in the array.  

In the first column, it is the viewer (or the Viewpoint) that is rotated around the array.  For 

instance, the speaker might be walking around the array, looking at it from a different position.  

In the third column, the Ground item is rotated.  The only different between the configuration of 

the spatial array in Column 1 and Column 3 is the orientation of the car.  Finally, the last column 

shows the whole array rotated in space.  Notice here that the array has been rotated 180º, but that 

the indication of the cardinal direction, north, remains constant.  The rows are read as follows 

using the row "intrinsic" as an example: for the intrinsic frame of reference, if the viewer is 

rotated, is the same description true?  -- yes; if the Ground object is rotatied, is the same 

description true?  -- no; if the whole array is rotated, is the same description true?  -- yes.

These facts under rotation that are summarized in Table 2, are part of the definition of the frames 

of reference.  Thus, they can be used as diagnostics to determine which frame of reference is 

being utilized in any locative construction. 

 

3.4.2.  The use of frames of reference in TVZ 

In this section I first give an overview of the use of the absolute frame of reference in TVZ 

(§3.4.2.1) and the use of the intrinsic and relative frames of reference in TVZ (§3.4.2.2).  I then 

consider how the type of Ground (§3.4.2.3) and choice of preposition (§3.4.2.4) main limit which 

frames of reference are available for any given locative construction. 

 

3.4.2.1.  The use of the absolute frame of reference in TVZ 

TVZ can use the absolute frame of reference by locating things in relation to the cardinal 

directions or other fixed landmarks, like Oaxaca City. The use of the absolute frame of reference 

is rather limited, so I have not looked at  this in depth.  Here I provide the data from SLQZ from 

 
 

170 

 

the dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) and provide correlates in TMZ or CVZ where 

possible. 

 

There are several different ways to talk about cardinal directions in SLQZ.  There are words 

for all four cardinal directions that begin with a word that looks like 'bone'.  The dictionary 

entries for these, as well as the entry for zu'aht 'bone' are below.  The word for 'north' contains 

the morpheme for 'up'. 

zu'aht yaàa', zu'tyaàa, zu'syaàa' north 

 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999: 376, Spanish omitted 

yaàa', gyaàa'  up; high, up high {Yaàa' bdèe'sëng gyihah "He lifted up the rock"; Yaàa' bzùu'b 
cafee ndaàa' tye'nn que'ity ygwàa'all bdòo' nyëng "Put the hot coffee up high in order that the 
baby won't touch it"} … 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999: 366; italics added, Spanish omitted  

 

The second morpheme in 'south' is unidentified: zu'aht tyùa'll, zu'tùa'll 'south' (Munro and Lopez, 

et al. 1999:376). 

 

The word for 'east', zu'aht sììi'lly, zu'sììilly, contains the morphme sììi'lly that on its own 

means 'breakfast', which is semantically and lexically related to rsìiilly 'morning' (Munro and 

Lopez, et al. 1999:281), the time at which the sun is in the east (Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999:376).  

sììi'lly  breakfast {Oordya' x:tèe' sììi'lly bzehnny Gye'eihlly "Mike arrived at breakfast time"} … 
  §§ The typical traditional meals and mealtimes are  cafee (usually taken around 6 or 7 am, or 
earlier), sììi'lly (9-10 am), cu'uhb (11 am - 1 pm), laizh:ih (2-3 pm), and xchihih (8-9 pm).  (Not 
all speakers agree that cafee and cu'uhb should be considered as meals, however.) 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999: 334; italics added, Spanish omitted  

 
Finally, the word for west contains the morpheme ca'ài, as indicated in the full SLQZ 

dictionary entry: zu'aht ca'ài, zu'tca'ài, zu'ca'ài 'west' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 

1999:376).  The semantic connection here is a little more difficult to see.  It may be that 

both 'west' and ca'ài are related to darkness, in that when the sun sets (in the west) it is 

dark, or in the early morning, while the sun is still rising in the east, it is dark in the west. 

 
 

171 

 

ca'ài  1. very early in the morning, when it's still dark (adv.) {Ca'ài ristiia' "I get up very early in 

the morning"}; 2. stupid… 

 

Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:85; italics added, Spanish omitted  

  All four of these direction words contain zu'aht.  This word can mean 'bone' or 'shell' 

and is a traditional unit of measurement, as indicated in the SLQZ dictionary entry.  It 

may be that the use of this word in cardinal directions is more directly related to this 

latter meaning. 

zu'aht  1. bone; 2. shell (of a turtle, for example)…; 3. traditional measure of length (the distance 
from the elbow to the end of the knuckles); 4. rattle Danza de la Pluma dancers wear on their 
feet…

There is evidence from Colonial Valley Zapotec that large cities may have been used as other 

reference points in an absolute frame of reference.  In (67), two houses are being contrasted—

one that faces toward Oaxaca City (which would have been roughly north from Coyotepec) and 

the other faces toward where the sun goes in (i.e. west).

The absolute Frame of Reference does not seem to be used except for locating large 

geographical entities in relation to other large geographical entities, much as in English.  

However, even large geographical entities can be located without the use of the absolute frame of 

references, as in (68).

3.4.2.2.  The use of the intrinsic and relative frames of reference in TVZ 

For locating most items, TVZ utilizes either the intrinsic or relative frames of reference.  In many 

situations both the intrinsic and relative frames of reference are available; for example, (69a) 

describes Figure 27 using the relative frame of reference while (69b) describes the same spatial 

array using the intrinsic frame of reference.

  However, in some cases only one frame of reference seems to be available.  In cases like (70) 

Figure 27.  woman and car 

 

describing Figure 28 and Figure 29, the relative frame of reference is used.  We know this is the 

relative frame of reference since the truth of the locative construction (70) persists under rotation 

of the Ground (the ball is rotated in Figure 29).  This may make sense on an intuitive level, since 

the Ground involved (a ball) does not have an inherent "side part" that could be utilized in the 

intrinsic frame of reference.

  However, in other cases, the lack of both options seems more surprising.  For example, (71b) 

 

 

can describe Figure 30 but (71a), which would represent the relative frame of reference, cannot.

In the following sections I show that the availability of a frame of reference to describe a 

spatial array can be affected by the type of Ground (§3.4.2.3) and the particular  preposition 

being used (§3.4.2.4). 

 
3.4.2.3.  Frames of reference and types of Ground 

In the following sections, I give evidence from TMZ (3.4.2.3.1) and Chickasaw (3.4.2.3.2) that 

the choice of frame of reference can be determined by aspects of the Ground including animacy 

and composition, i.e. the presence or absence of a particular body and component part. 

3.4.2.3.1. Frames of reference and types of Ground in TVZ 

Recall that in many locative situations both the intrinsic and relative frames of reference are 

available to describe a spatial array in TVZ: the use of (72a) to describe Figure 31 illustrates the 

relative frame of reference and the use of (72b) to describe Figure 31 illustrates the intrinsic 

frame of reference.

  However, for some types of Grounds, only the intrinsic frame of reference is available.  

Figure 31.  woman and car 

 

When the Ground is an animal or human, the relative frame of reference is no longer available: 

(73a) cannot describe Figure 32 and (73b) cannot describe Figure 33.  However, the intrinsic 

frame of reference is available: (73a) can describe Figure 33  and (73b) can describe Figure 32).

In TVZ both deers and cars have inherent component parts cwe'eh 'side' and dehts 'back', so 

the difference in the availability of frame of reference cannot be accounted for by the 

composition of the Ground per se.  Instead, it seems to be that animacy is involved: animate 

Grounds force an intrinsic frame of reference, while most inanimate Grounds allow for the 

possibility of both. (Other factors, such as the meaning of the preposition (cf. §3.4.2.4) may force 

further constraints on the availability of the frames of reference). 

 

There is one type of inanimate item which also forces an intrinsic frame of reference: a 

house.  When a house is the Ground only the intrinsic frame of reference is available.  For 

example, (74) can describe Figure 34, but cannot describe a situation where a person is standing 

'beside' from the perspective of the viewer (e.g. Figure 35), unless the person is also at the area of 

space projecting from the house's side.

3.4.2.3.2. Frames of reference and types of Ground in Chickasaw 

 

In Chickasaw,14 the type of Ground can also affect the frames of reference that are available.  

In this case, it seems to be the composition of the Ground that is relevant.  For example, if an 

item has a component part that can be identified as the left side, then only the intrinsic frame of 

reference is available for using alhfabi' 'at the left side of'.  If an item has no component part that 

can be identified as the left side, then only the relative frame of reference is available.  This 

makes the use of alhfabi' 'at the left side of' seem strikingly different from English.   

  Consider the example below.  In Chickasaw, a car has an inherent component part 'left side'.  

The use of 'at the left side of' with a Ground such as a car requires the intrinsic frame of 

reference: (75a) can describe Figure 36, but not Figure 37.  This is contrast with the English 

description in (75b) which can describe Figure 37, but not Figure 36. 

 

                                                 
14 The Chickasaw data is from joint work with Pamela Munro.  Without her assistance, I would not have 
been able to work with this wonderful language.

In Chickasaw, a table does not have a component part that can be identified as 'its left side'.  

When locating a Figure in reference to this type of Ground, we see that there is no intrinsic frame 

of reference available, and only the relative frame of reference can be used.  Note, then, the 

contrast: (75a) cannot describe Figure 37, but (76a) can describe Figure 38.

15 Chickasaw positional verbs are very complex (see Munro 2006).  I present simplified glosses here. 
16 Note that this sentence is bi-clausal.  Thus it may be that 'where the car is standing' is the Ground and 
not the car per se.  This is worthy of further investigation.

Thus, while the details of each system are different, in both TMZ and Chickasaw the type of 

Ground is involved in determining which frame of reference can be employed.  The type of 

Ground, specifically its animacy or composition, may play a crucial role in the semantics of 

location by constraining the choice of frame of reference.  The specific way this works seems to 

be language specific, and there remains much cross-linguistic work to be done on this question. 

 

3.4.2.4.  Frames of reference and prepositions 

The meaning of a preposition (or other locative) may itself constrain the availability of frames of 

reference.  This phenomenon has been noted before, e.g. Levinson (2003): 

Linguistics  expressions  may  be  specialized  to  a  frame  of  reference,  so  we  cannot  assume  that 
choice  of  frame  of  reference  lies  entirely  outside  language,  for  example  in  spatial  thinking,  as 
some  have  suggested.    But  spatial  relators  may  be  ambiguous  (or  semantically  general)  across 
frames, and often are. 

Levinson 2003:53 
 

There are several prepositions in TMZ which by the nature of their meaning allow only the 

intrinsic frame of reference, regardless of the type of Ground.  However, I am not aware of any 

prepositions in TMZ which require a relative frame of reference.   

  Consider the preposition zh:ààa'n, which is related to the component part 'buttocks'.  In (77) 

it seems to mean 'behind' in that it can describe Figure 39.

Figure 39. woman and deer I 

 

 
  However, now consider the fact that (77) can describe Figure 40 but not  Figure 41.  Clearly, 

then, the English translation 'behind' is not sufficient for understanding the meaning and use of 

this preposition. 

Figure 40. woman and deer II 

Figure 41. woman and deer III 

 
  Recall that zh:ààa'n is related to the component part 'buttocks'.  In order for the preposition 

 

 

zh:ààa'n to be used appropriately, the Figure must be located in the area of space projecting from 

the Ground's buttocks.  This projecting space (cf. Hollenbach 1995) is  indicated with arrows in 

below in Figure 42, Figure 43, and Figure 44.  This explains why zh:ààa'n initially seemed to 

 
 

182 

mean 'behind' in (77) describing Figure 39: in this spatial array there is no contrast between the 

meaning of 'behind' the Ground and 'at the buttocks of' the Ground.

The meaning of the TVZ preposition zh:ààa'n, in other words, relates directly to the meaning 

of the corresponding referential component part noun 'buttocks'.   

  Other prepositions that require the intrinsic frame of reference in TVZ include nnaàa' 

'on the hand of; on the branch of' (79a) and the borrowed preposition pu'unn 'on the tip 

of; at the top of' (79b).

3.4.3.  Revisiting the intrinsic frame of reference 

A locative system such as the one in TMZ, which has component part locatives, is especially 

relevant in testing the definition of the intrinsic frame of reference, since it allows for the 

possibility that the component part preposition function as both the Relator and Anchor in 

 
 

183 

 

calculating location.  (See §3.4.1.1 for the original discussion of the intrinsic frame of reference.)  

In this section I suggest a refinement of the definition of the intrinsic frame of reference so that it 

makes explicit reference to the different linguistic types of referential body and component parts, 

namely inherent and relative component parts, as defined in §3.2.   

 

The problem with the current definition is in the lack of explicitness about the relation 

between a component part preposition's meaning and the related referential component part.  I 

will demonstrate this below by comparing the options in describing two spatial arrays: Figure 45 

and Figure 46. 

  Below we see that component part preposition dehts can be used in (80) to describe Figure 

45.

In order to determine the frame of reference involved, we can test whether (80) remains a 

Figure 45.  person and child 

 

description of the spatial array under rotation of the array and the Ground as shown in Table 3.  

(I've left out the column specifying rotation of the viewer or Viewpoint, since this is only needed 

to further discriminate the absolute frame of reference from the intrinsic and relative frame of 

 
 

184 

reference.)  We see that the definitional facts of rotation diagnose the use of (80) in describing 

Figure 45 as an instance of the use of the intrinsic frame of reference, since the description 

persists under rotation of the array, but does not persist under rotation of the Ground.

  Again, utilizing the definitional facts of rotation, shown in Table 4, the locative relation 

matches that of the intrinsic frame of reference.  The description (i.e. (81)) of the spatial array 

(Figure 46) persists under rotation of the array, but does not persist under rotation of the Ground.

Thus the definitional facts under rotation for (80) describing Figure 45  and (81) describing 

describing Figure 46 

Figure 46 seem to be the same— namely they both satisfy that criteria for the intrinsic frame of 

reference.  However, I will show below that despite functioning the same under the definitional 

facts of rotation, the preposition dehts may not mean the same thing in both cases.  This evidence 

leads to the necessity of refining the definition of the intrinsic frame of reference. 

  Recall that the intrinsic frame of reference utilizes a spatial relator R, which in these cases is 

the component part preposition.  (I believe Levinson's use of "spatial relator" is equivalent to my 

use of "locative". This spatial relator (or locative) relates a Figure to a Ground on the basis of an 

anchor point.  This anchor point is "usually" the part of the Ground named by relator. 

[A]n intrinsic spatial relator R is a binary spatial relation, with arguments F[igure] and G[round], 
where R typically names a part of G.  The origin X of the coordinate system C is always on the 
volumetric centre of  G.   An  intrinsic  relation  R(F,G)  asserts  that  F  lies  in  a  search  domain 
extending from G on the basis of an angle or line projected from the centre of G, through an 
anchor  point  A  (usually  the  named  facet  'R'),  outwards  for  a  determined  distance.    F  and  G 
may be any objects whatsoever (including ego), and F may be a part of G.  

Levinson 2003:42; bold added 

 
 

The two uses of dehts described above differ in whether the anchor point is or is not the same 

as the relator.  This can be seen once we realize that the back area of the deer is not 'the deer's 

 
 

186 

back' in TVZ.  The phrase dehts bzêiny refers to the area where the spine is, circled in Figure 47, 

not the backside, circled in Figure 48.  This is demonstrated in (82).

  With this in mind, we can now see that while dehts can be both the relator (R) and anchor (A) 

in (80), it cannot be the anchor in (81).  This is demonstrated visually in Figure 49 and Figure 50.

  One way this apparent asymmetry could be resolved is by the assignment of component parts 

via an "armature".  Ultimately, I find this explanation unsatisfactory, as I will explain below.  

But first I will demonstrate how this type of assignment would work.   

 

The following description from Levinson shows his use of an "armature" in assigning 

component parts to items in English.  I'll follow Bohnemeyer (p.c.)17 in calling such component 

parts "generalized component parts". 

The  English  intrinsic  system  can  be  thought  of  as  a  six-sided,  box-like  'armature'  that  is 
imposed  on  objects  when  in  their  canonical  position  (the  position  in  which  they  normally, 
naturally occur or are intended to be used).  The cubic armature is oriented by gravity, so the top 
side of an object is uppermost, and the bottom the underneath facet.  Front and back are found in 
this way too, by taking 'perceptual apparatus' (as with animals, cameras etc.), canonical direction 
of motion, canonical direction of use etc. into account.  The two remaining facets are the sides (if 
no front of back can be found, then the object will have up to four sides)... Objects can obviously 
resist  these  assignments  if,  like  cubes  and  balls,  they  lack  both  inherent  and  functional 
asymmetries)… 

Levinson 2003:77; bold added 

 

 

Since we saw that the definitional facts of rotation diagnosed the relationship of (81) 

describing Figure 46 as an instance of the intrinsic frame of reference, it may seem that the 

backside of the deer must in some way be conceived of as dehts bzêiny 'the back of the deer'.  

The notion of  the "armature" could be used to assign such a generalized component part to the 

deer, illustrated in Figure 51.  In this case the generalized front (i.e. the front of the "armature") 

could be aligned with the inherent loh bzêiny 'front of the deer'.  This alignment would then 

create a generalized dehts bzêiny as the side opposite the 'front of the deer'.

Figure 51.  assigning generalized component part to a deer via an "armature" 

 

 

With the generalized component part dehts 'back' assigned using the "armature", the intrinsic 

spatial relator dehts can now also function as the anchor point, as shown in Figure 52.  This 

makes the calculation of the locative relation seem parallel to that shown for the person and the 

child, in Figure 49.

  My concern with the assignment of generalized component parts is that these parts are 

defined in locative relations in order to explain locative relations, i.e. the assignment of

generalized component parts is circular.  Let's reconsider how we came to conceive of the back 

part of the deer dehts bzêiny in Figure 52.  Because this locative relationship met the criterion for 

the intrinsic frame of reference, it needed to be the case that the Figure was located in reference 

to the Ground based on some component part of the Ground.  Using an "armature", we coerced 

that area into a generalized component part dehts bzêiny.  We did this to explain the locative 

relationship, but the only "evidence" that we have that this component part is thus named is that 

same locative relationship.  Thus the circularity: why do we think that the back part of the deer 

must be a generalized component part dehts bzêiny? Because dehts bzêiny is used to locate a 

Figure in relation to the Ground which is the area of space projecting from that part of the deer.  

The locative relation is used to create a generalized component part, which itself is supposed to 

explain the locative relation. 

 

I do not think we need the notion of generalized component part at all.  Everything that could 

be calculated as a generalized component part will fall into one of the following three categories: 

inherent component part, relative component part, or simply a locative relation (i.e. not a 

component part).   

  Below I present a paradigm showing that a generalized component part may or may not 

correspond to a relative component part.  (Note that the relative frame of reference is used in the 

expression of location here, so the component part is not necessary in calculating the locative 

relation.  The purpose here is to show the lack of correlation only.) 

 

In TMZ a ball has a relative component part cwe'eh:

In contrast to a ball, a bottle (quite surprisingly to me, since I do not understand what the 

 

 

difference is) does not have a component part cwe'eh, as shown in (85).

bottle is dark', but there is no part of the bottle that is 'the side' 

 
In response to my surprise at this (since I asked for verification several times) my consultant 

said, "La botella no tiene [The bottle doesn't have a] cwe'eh, pero [but] when you put something 

next to it, it's beside it."  (86) shows the locative use of cwe'eh bote'iy.

So while cwe'eh 'beside' can be used to relate the tree to both the ball and the bottle, cwe'eh 

also happens to refer to the component part of the ball in the search domain in Figure 59, while it 

does not refer to any component part of the bottle Figure 60. These examples show that using a 

component part locative in the relative frame of reference is independent of the Ground having a 

referential (relative) component part.  The "armature" may not be sensitive to referential 

component parts, but rather to locative relations.  Thus "generalized component parts" are not 

component parts at all, but are locative relations.  Sometimes these correspond to component 

parts, but not always, as the assignment of referential component parts is different from the use 

of a component part term in a locative expression.

Table 5 presents a summary of the relationship between my terminology for component part 

and other terminology.  While Levinson (2003:76) classifies the front of a moving ship as an 

intrinsic feature of the ship, my classification depends on the type of ship involved.  The front of 

an asymmetrical ship is an inherent component part, while the front of a symmetrical ship  must 

be defined via motion; thus it is a relative component part.  The back of a ball can be calculated 

via the "armature", and thus seems to qualify as a generalized component part.  In my 

terminology this is also a relative component part, since the part refered to as the back depends 

on the location and orientaion of the ball in space in relation to observers.  Finally, dehts bzêiny 

meaning 'the backside of the deer (i.e the buttocks area)' could be calculated as a generalized 

component part, but in fact I feel that there is no such component part at all.

My suggestion for refinement of the intrinsic frame of reference is that it should be calculated 

based on an "inherent component part".  Perhaps my real suggestion, then, is in how an inherent 

component part should be defined. 

 
 
3.5.  Viewpoint 

As mentioned in §3.4.1.2, Viewpoint is a definitional component of the relative frame of 

reference.  In this section, I provide an example of its use in calculating location in TVZ.  

Consider (87), where dehts 'behind' can be used to describe Figure 61 but not Figure 62.  Based 

on its ungrammaticality in describing Figure 62,  dehts does not seem to mean 'behind' using a 

relative frame of reference.  At first glance it may seem that its use in describing Figure 61 is an 

example of the intrinsic frame of reference.  However, as I will show below, this cannot 

necessarily be calculated using the intrinsic frame of reference, since the woman is not located 

near the part of the deer that is referred to with dehts bzêiny 'the back of the deer' (circled in 

Figure 63).

3.5.1.  Problems for calculating dehts bzêiny using the intrinsic frame of reference 

It may not be immediately obvious that the woman is not located near the back of the deer in 

Figure 61.  However, recall from (82) that in TVZ dehts bzêiny 'the back of the deer' is the area 

where its spine is (circled in Figure 63), and not the area where its buttocks are (circled in Figure 

64).  Thus (82), repeated below as (88) for the reader's convenience, cannot be used to describe 

the area circled in Figure 64, even if the deer is turned so that the circled area were farthest from 

the observer, in an attempt to facilitate a relative component part reading.  Dehts bzêiny 'the back 

of the deer' is only appropriate to refer to the area circled in Figure 63.

  However, we are now faced with a problem in calculating how (87) can be used to describe 

Figure 61.  We have apparently eliminated the intrinsic frame of reference as a possible means.  

The intrinsic frame of reference cannot be used to calculate 'at the back of' based on an inherent 

component part 'back', since the Figure is not in the area of space projecting from the deer's back, 

as illustrated below in Figure 65.  If dehts means 'at the back of', i.e. if it is calculated using an 

intrinsic frame of reference based on the inherent component part 'back', then we would expect 

the locative relation to be calculated similar to this: Let there be a line L which begins at the 

center of the Ground, and proceeds outward to the subpart of Ground labeled DEHTS 'BACK'.  The 

Figure is [DEHTS | AT THE BACK OF] the Ground if the Figure is located on L in some area that is 

not occupied by the Ground.  However, when we apply this to Figure 65, we encounter a 

problem: the Figure (i.e. the woman) is not located on Line L!

Problem: The Figure is not located on L! 

Figure 65. dehts bzêiny: inherent component part dehts 'back' with intrinsic frame of 

reference 

 

  One way to maintain that the intrinsic frame or reference is in use, is to assign the component 

part name DEHTS 'BACK' to the "backside" of the deer.  One could do this in several ways, 

including assigning a relative component part DEHTS 'BACK' (as opposite of the inherent 

component part loh 'face').  Then one could proceed as follows: let there be a line L which begins 

at the center of the Ground, and runs horizontally though the center of the Ground and extends 

outwards through the part assigned the label DEHTS 'BACK' a determined distance.  The Figure is 

[DEHTS | AT THE BACK OF] the Ground if the Figure is located on L in some area that is not 

occupied by the Ground.  The problem with this technique, however, is that dehts bzêiny 'the 

back of the deer' labels the wrong part of the deer (cf. (88)).  We know that the part of the deer 

circled in Figure 64  can never be referred to with dehts bzêiny.  So while the Line L can now be 

used to locate the Figure in reference to the Ground, we haven't solved the problem because the 

component parts of the Ground have been improperly labeled.  In fact, it was only because we 

 
 

197 

 

 

knew that dehts bzêiny can be used to describe the desired locative relationship that we were 

motivated to label the relevant component part dehts bzêiny.  Labeling the "backside (rear)" of 

the deer as dehts bzêiny is circular: we want to do it to account for the locative relationship, but 

our only evidence for it is the locative relationship we are trying to account for.  There is no 

other independent support that this area is the dehts bzêiny in any way, and in fact there is 

evidence to the contrary (88).  In addition, this solution might be problematic since it allows the 

inherent frame of reference to be calculated based on a relative component part.  I believe this is 

not something that we actually ever see attested.  This attempt is summarized and displayed 

visually in Figure 66.

3.5.2.  A solution involving an obligatory shift of Viewpoint 

In this section, I present one possible solution to the problem presented above,18 namely that the 

intrinsic frame of reference is not being used, but that rather the relative frame of reference is 

being used in combination with an obligatory shift of the Viewpoint to the Ground. 

  An initial concern with this hypothesis might be with the choice of frame of reference.  

Under the definitional facts of rotation, this scenario met all the criterion for an intrinsic frame of 

reference—so how could it not be?  If the facts of rotation are definitional, these should require 

the scenario to be classified as an example of the use of the intrinsic frame of reference.  

However, in the definitional facts of rotation, the Viewpoint of the relative frame of reference is 

assumed to be outside of the locative relation itself, and is schematized as being the observer.  

However, we know that the Viewpoint can be shifted, and if the Viewpoint were in fact shifted 

to the Viewpoint of the Ground, then the behavior concerning the definitional facts under 

rotation are not surprising, and are in fact exactly what we would predict.  This means, as far as I 

can tell, that the definitional facts of rotation for the intrinsic frame of reference and for the 

relative frame of reference with the Viewpoint shifted to the Ground are identical.   

  Under this hypothesis the locative dehts means something more like 'behind (from the 

Viewpoint of the Ground)'.  This is schematized below in Figure 67, and could perhaps be 

formalized in a way like the following: let there be a line L which begins at the subpart of the 

Viewpoint (which in this case is the Ground) 'front', and runs horizontally though the center of 

the Viewpoint (in this case the Ground) and extends outwards a determined distance.  The Figure 

                                                 
18 I also believe this is another potential solution to this problem which maintains the use of the intrinsic 
frame of reference, but defines dehts not in terms of the component part dehts, but in terms of something 
like "opposite of the component part loh 'face'".  I believe this has potential because it maintains the use 
of the intrinsic frame of reference, which is desirable, and it defines the locative relationship in terms of 
an inherent component part (in this case not the homophonous one to the locative, however).  I do not 
present this hypothesis in detail here, but hope to in future work.  Thanks to Pamela Munro and Carson 
Schütze for discussion on this.

3.5.3.  Conclusions 

As we will see more in the next section, in TVZ the contrast between inherent and relative 

component parts together with the contrast between intrinsic and relative frame of reference 

account for most locative meanings.  In general inanimates have both the intrinsic and relative 

frames of reference available, and if the Ground has an inherent component part it usually takes 

precedence over any potential assigned relative component part.  With human Grounds it seems 

to be the case that only the intrinsic frame of reference is available, based on the inherent 

 
 

200 

 

component parts of the Ground.  The main problem, like the one presented in this section, is with 

animal Ground.  More specifically the problem seems to reside with dehts.  Why might this be?  

 

I believe, that the limits of the problem area (i.e. that the problem is only evident with the 

locative dehts and with animal Grounds) is in fact evidence for an anthropomorphic model in the 

development of component part prepositions in Zapotec.  The meaning of dehts must have 

developed based on a human model, but now has been grammaticized. Its use with animal 

Grounds as described in this section attests to its path of semantic change and 

grammaticalization. For a human Ground an inherent frame of reference based on 'back' and 

'behind' based on a relative frame of reference with the Viewpoint shifted to the Ground will 

result in the same locative relationship: i.e. 'at the back of' a human and 'behind' the human are 

the same from the human's point of view!  However, for an animal Ground this is not necessarily 

the case: at the animal's back is not the same as behind the animal from the animal's Viewpoint 

in TVZ. 

 

The data in this section have also shown that Viewpoint is an independent semantic element 

in the locative system of TVZ. 

 
 
3.6.  The locative meaning of TMZ component part prepositions, revisited 

In this section I discuss the meaning of some of component part prepositions first introduced in 

§3.1, in light of the intervening discussion of types of component parts, frames of reference, and 

Viewpoint.  While in §3.1, I presented the component part prepositions and meanings in TVZ 

(i.e. both TMZ and SLQZ), in this section I look at the details of some patterns of meaning only 

in TMZ. 

 
 

201 

 

 

I discuss the prepositions by type of meaning.  First I provide an example of a preposition 

with a very limited meaning: nnaàa' 'at the hand of' only allows in the intrinsic frame of 

reference and it cannot be used at all with a Ground that does not have a component part nnaàa' 

'hand' (§3.6.1).  Then I present an example of a preposition which require the intrinsic frame of 

reference for any Ground that has the referential related component part, but unlike nnaàa', does 

allow the use of the relative frame of reference with a Ground that does not have the relevant 

component part: cwe'eh 'at the side of' (§3.6.2).  Next, I present an example of a preposition with 

a more liberal type of meaning: dehts 'behind' (§3.6.3); unlike the other prepositions presented in 

this section, dehts allows both the intrinsic and relative frames of reference with differentiated 

inanimates.  The last meaning type I present is that of loh (§3.6.4) which, like all the other 

prepositions, requires the intrinsic frame of reference with human and house Grounds, but loh 

allows the relative frame of reference with animal Grounds, as well as with differentiated and 

undifferentiated inanimate Grounds.  Finally, in §3.6.5 I present a summary of the extant types of 

meaning of component part locatives in TVZ. 

 

3.6.1.  Nnaàa' 'at the hand of' 

The component part preposition nnaàa' 'at the hand of' has a meaning that may seem very un-

preposition like at first.  I classify this word as a preposition based on syntactic criterion (cf. 

Chapter 2), and show in Chapter 4 that the type of meaning a locative has is not a valid criterion 

for discriminating syntactic category, based on joint work with Munro (e.g. Lillehaugen and 

Munro 2006).  That being said, in this section I demonstrate the type of meaning this preposition 

has, showing that it requires an intrinsic frame of reference, regardless of the type of Ground. 

 
 

202 

  When used with human Grounds, nnaàa' means 'in the hand of' (89) or 'on the hand of' (90a). 

(Recall that 'hand' in Zapotec actually refers to the whole area from the fingertips to the elbow, 

not stopping at the wrist as in English.)  With an animal Ground, nnaàa' means 'on the front foot 

/ lower leg of' (90b).

no inherent component part 'side', such as a ball (§3.6.2.5).  The data are summarized below with

In TMZ, a person has an inherent component part cwe'eh 'side' (§2.2.1); a relative component 

part cwe'eh cannot be assigned to a person. As shown in (93), with a human Ground the intrinsic 

frame of reference is allowed (since it can describe both Figure 69 and Figure 70) and the 

relative frame of reference is not (since it cannot describe Figure 71 or Figure 72).

where the only difference is the orientation of the Figure.  As far as I can tell, the orientation of 

the Figure never matters, so I will not continue to give such variants. 

 

3.6.2.2.  Cwe'eh 'beside' with animal as Ground

3.6.2.3.  Cwe'eh 'beside' with house as Ground 

Recall from §3.2.2.2 that a house has an inherent component part cwe'eh 'side'; and 'side' cannot 

be assigned as a relative component part.  When a house is the Ground, the preposition cwe'eh 

 
 

207 

 

'beside' must be interpreted using the intrinsic frame of reference.  The relative frame of 

reference is not allowed; the intrinsic frame of reference is always used.  This is evidenced by the 

fact that (96) can Figure 77, where the Figure is standing in the area of space projecting from the 

house's side, but is in front of the house from the Viewpoint of the camera.  The fact that (96) 

cannot be used to describe Figure 78 shows that the relative frame of reference is not available.  

Here the Figure is standing in the area of space projecting from the house's back, but is beside 

the house from the Viewpoint of the camera.

The same pattern can be seen when the Ground is a car, which, like a person, deer, and house,

When the Ground has no inherent component part which can be referred to with cwe'eh 'side' (for 

instance, when the Ground is a ball), the inherent frame of reference is not possible. (99) shows 

that when a Figure (in this case a man) is beside a ball, based on a relative frame of reference 

with the Viewpoint of the camera (the observer), regardless of the orientation of the Figure, the 

word cwe'eh 'beside' can be used to refer to its location.

Dehts can also be used with both inherent and relative frames of reference depending on the type 

of Ground.  For humans (§3.6.3.1), animals (§3.6.3.2), and houses, only the inherent frame of 

reference is available.  For inanimates, both frames of references are available: if an inanimate 

has the component part dehts 'back' the intrinsic frame of reference can be used (§3.6.3.3).  If is 

doesn't have an inherent component part back, the intrinsic Frame of Reference is not applicable, 

and so by default only the relative frame of reference is used (§3.6.3.4).

When the Ground is a human, dehts can only be used with an inherent frame of reference: (100) 

can be used to describe Figure 85 and Figure 87, where the Figure (the man) is in the area of 

space projecting from the Ground's back.  But (100) cannot be used to describe Figure 86, where 

the man is behind the woman from a relative frame of reference, using the Viewpoint of the

It is a bit more complicated question as to whether or not dehts can be used with a relative frame 

of reference with the Ground is an animal.  However, (102) does show that dehts cannot be used 

with a relative frame of reference with the Viewpoint of the camera (or observer).  (For

The use of dehts with a differentiated inanimate Ground is ant instance where both frames of

use of the relative frame of reference and the use of (103) to describe Figure 91 is an instance of 

the use of the inherent frame of reference.

Loh is the preposition with the most options for the use of the relative frame of reference.  Like 

all other locatives, only the intrinsic frame of reference is used with the Ground is a human 

(§3.6.4.1) or a house (§3.6.4.2).  However, with an animal Ground, both frames of reference are 

available (§3.6.4.3).  Moreover, with inanimates, it seems that the relative frame of reference can 

be required, at least in some situations (§3.6.4.4).  These uses are summarized below in Table 9 

and exemplified in the following sections.

that relative frame of reference is not available.

only the intrinsic frame of reference is available, as shown by the fact that (106) can describe 

Figure 95, but not Figure 96.  Loh never means 'on' when the Ground is a house; (106) being 

used to describe Figure 97 is infelicitous.

Loh 'in front of; on' with animal as Ground 

When loh is used with an animal Ground, the intrinsic frame of reference is possible: (107) can

only with the meaning 'on': (108) can describe Figure 100; not the meaning 'in front of': (107) 

cannot describe Figure 99.  Unfortunately, further work on the relation between the correlation 

between frames of reference and the locative meanings of loh is part of future research.

  As discussed in §3.4.2.3 the type of Ground involved in a locative relationship can may play 

a crucial role in the semantics by constraining the choice of frame of reference or by acting with 

the preposition to determine where the Viewpoint will be centered.  Table 11 summarizes the 

types of frames of reference allowed for each Ground, as shown in this section.  Human and 

house Grounds require an intrinsic frame of reference.  Animals and differentiated inanimates 

allow the use of both the inherent and relative frames of reference (under the right conditions).  

Finally undifferentiated inanimates can be Ground in locative relationship involving a relative 

frame of reference.

3.7.  Component part terms in directional constructions 

Motion verbs,19 such as brììia' 'left', are intransitive, as can be seen in (113).  In these sentences 

the source of the direction is not overtly mentioned, although in both cases it had been recently 

mentioned in the discourse (in Zhat:8 and Zhat:36 respectively). 

                                                 
19 I have previously written briefly about the use of component part prepositions in directional 
constructions in Lillehaugen 2003, although since then I have changed my analysis of this type of 
construction.

constructions.  However, the use of component part prepositions in directional constructions is 

not straightforward syntactically or semantically.  As can be seen in the pairs (115a, b) and 

(116a, b) the preposition is required in these cases in order to express the source (115a) or the 

goal (116a). It seems as though a simple noun phrase, such as me'es 'table' cannot function as a 

source or a goal in these directional construction.  Its presence is not licensed by the intransitive 

verb (115c, 116c).  (There is much more syntactic work to be done on this topic; e.g. the phrase 

stoohby laad 'another side, the other side' (114a) can be added to a directional sentence without a 

 
 

219 

preposition.  It would appear based on this limited data, then, that this type of quantified noun 

phrase functions differently from a simple (unquantified) noun phrase.)

  However, while loh seems syntactically required in (115a) and (116a), what meaning is it 

contributing?  It cannot be expressing the direction of the motion: notice that loh is used both in a 

sentence where the motion is directed at the object of loh and one where the motion is directed 

away from the object of loh.  Moreover, the directional information seems to be completely 

contained in the verb, as evidenced from (115c) and (116c).   

  Although more work is needed, I believe that directional verbs allow locational adjuncts of 

certain syntactic types (prepositional phrases (114b,  d), adverbs (114c), quantified noun 

phrases? (114a), but not simple noun phrases (115b, 116b)) and that the interpretation of these 

locational adjuncts as source or goal will depend on the meaning of the particular verb.  In 

(115b) loh me'es is interpreted as a goal, since byèe'py means 'went up', and in (116c) loh me'es 

is interpreted as a source, since bye'eht means 'got off'. 

 
 

220 

  Notice that despite these syntactic and semantic complications, data from the use of 

component part locatives in directional constructions can be used to support the hypothesis that 

component part locatives are not of the same syntactic category as nouns, given that the phrase 

loh me'es can function as a source in (117a) while me'es cannot (117b).

The final examples presented in this section are of têë'ix being used to indicate a location that is a

particularly interesting since the object of têë'ix (SLQZ tèi'x) in both cases is yu'uh 'house' and 

the object of the verb in both cases is gyèe'ts 'paper'.

3.8.  Non-locative loh  

As first documented for TVZ in Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999, the preposition loh (with locative 

meanings including 'in front of' or 'on'; cf §3.1.5 and §3.6.4) also has a large range of non-

locative meanings, such as 'to' (128a) and 'from' (128b), as exemplified here for TMZ.

I present the range of non-locative meanings of loh in modern TVZ in §3.8.1. I consider 

some cross-linguistics characteristics of dative case in §3.8.2, and then examine the ways in 

which modern non-locative loh is consistent with (§3.8.3) and inconsistent with (§3.8.4) dative 

case.  In §3.8.5 I present the non-locative uses of loh in Colonial Valley Zapotec, and I offer 

conclusions in §3.8.6. 

 

This investigation would not have been possible without the work done on SLQZ and the 

wonderful information available in the dictionary (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999).  Some of these 

ideas have been discussed previously in Lillehaugen 2004d and 2005b. 

 

3.8.1.  Non-locative loh in modern TVZ 

The non-locative meanings of loh seem to be very broad, including 'to' (128a), 'from' (128b,  

129), 'in' (130), 'for' (131), 'at' (132), and 'than' (133).

the glossing in this dissertation.

As is perhaps obvious by my translations of the examples, it is not always clear what the best 

translation of loh is in these non-locative sentences.  Perhaps more detailed semantic work might 

make some of this clearer, but note that the differences between 'in', 'through' and 'at' in (130) in 

English are subtle at best, even for a native speaker, and this might not be the type of meaning 

difference I can access in Zapotec via elicitation. 

 

These non-locative meanings in addition to others are documented in the entry for loh in the 

SLQZ dictionary, which also gives examples of many of these types of non-locative meanings.

 Munro and Lopez in prep.:131; Spanish omitted; italics and some bold added 

 
MacLaury mentioned another common use of non-locative loh: to mark the addressee in verbs of 

speaking.  

Zapotec  does  not  use  body-part  terms  as  prepositions,  nor  even  as  markers  of  goal,  path,  and 
source; its dative extensions are restricted to verbs of speaking, which locate one person in front 
of another… 

MacLaury 1989:120  

 

 
 

225 

 

And  while  it  is  does  not  seem  to  be  true  that  loh's  "dative"  extensions  are  limited  to  verbs  of 

speaking, it is the case that loh can be used before addressees (134); in fact in some cases loh 

seems to be required before these objects (134b, e).  Although given the grammaticality of (134c, 

f)  the  obligatoriness  of  loh  might  depend  on  the  particular  construction,  speaker,  or  language 

variety.

In addition to the use described above, MacLaury states that loh can be used with an "expression

of abstract location". 

Exclusively 'face' functions as a dative marker and as an expression of abstract location; here it is 
suffixed with a pronominal enclitic or with a noun, which denotes an addressable dative object or 
a nonphysical situation… 

MacLaury 1989:120  

 
 

226 

 

Unfortunately, not examples were given, so I'm not sure if the following examples are exactly 

what MacLaury had in mind, but loh does seem to be used what I would call abstract locations in 

TMZ (135).

Finally, MacLaury states that there are different syntactic realizations of these loh phrases.  

He states that loh phrases which are of the dative construction type must follow the verb, and loh 

phrases which are abstract locations are syntactically unrestricted (MacLaury 1989:120).  I have 

not found any such restrictions in TMZ; loh phrases with addressees (136a, b) and loh phrases 

with abstract locations (136c) can both occur before the verb.

Many of the uses of non-locative loh seem similar to the uses of a dative case marker.  In this 

section I will consider some definitions of dative case and the realization of dative in Chickasaw 

in order to evaluate the possibility of non-locative loh being a dative marker. 

 
 

227 

 

 

SIL's online Glossary of Linguistic Terms (Loos et al. 1999)  says that "Dative case is a case 

that marks any of the following: indirect objects…; nouns having the role of recipient (as of 

things given), beneficiary of an action, or possessor of an item."   

  Blake offers the following definition of dative case. 

The  dative…  will  typically  include  those  (functions)  listed  as  (a),  (b),  and  (c)…  and  quite 
frequently functions (d) to (h): 
a.  indirect object of some two-place verbs low in the transitivity scale (e.g. verbs such as HELP, 
SEEK or LIKE) 
b.  indirect object of a few three place verbs such as GIVE and SHOW [LEND] 
c.    the  roles  of  purpose  (She  went  for  fish)  and  beneficiary  (She  went  for  (on  behalf  of)  her 
mother)… 
d.  possessor… 
e.  destination… 
f.  the indirect object of a detransitivised construction as in the antipassive of various languages… 
g.  the direct object in certain aspects or tenses… 
h.  the indirect object of certain verbs or of all verbs in certain aspects.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blake 2001:143 

 
  While Zapotec non-locative loh does not serve all of the functions listed above (e.g. it does 

not manifest the uses in (d) – (h) as far as I know; cf. §3.8.4), it does seem to have some of the 

uses listed in (a) – (c) (cf. §3.8.3).  In fact, however, there are two questions to be asked here.  Is 

Zapotec non-locative loh a case marker? Is Zapotec non-locative loh dative?  Before turning to 

these questions, then, for comparison, I present data from Chickasaw, which has  a dative 

applicative prefix. 

 

The Chickasaw dative applicative prefix im- and its phonological variants, like the Zapotec 

non-locative loh, can be translated in English in a variety of ways, including 'to', 'for', 'at', 'in', 

and 'from' (Table 12).

Table 12.  Chickasaw im-  (dative) applicative  (from Gorbet and Munro (2002) Table 3) 

 
While this range of translations seems broad, the presence of an additional human participant is 

common to most of them. 

What seems to be central to the dative is a directional meaning with a human goal, as in im-alla 
'to arrive to, come to (someone)' (cf. ala 'to arrive (at)').    

Gorbet and Munro 2002:11 

 

In  addition  to  human  goal,  the  Chickasaw  dative  often  is  used  with  a  benefactive  meaning,  as 

explained below and exemplified in (137). 

There are two rather common other extensions of the two aspects of the basic directional meaning 
of  the  dative.  The  first  is  the  benefactive,  which  is  a  common  metonymic  consequence  of  the 
recipient role… 

Gorbet and Munro 2002:11 

 
137.    Paska   an-toshaffi-tok. (Chickasaw; Gorbet and Munro 2002) 
 
 
 
Another  common  use  of  the  Chickasaw  dative  is  as  the  addressee  of  verbs  of  communication.  

bread  1SIII.dat-break_off-pt 
'He broke off a piece of the bread for me' 

 
 

Gorbet and Munro explain this meaning below. 

The  second  is  the  addressee  of  a  verb  of  communication,  a  metaphorical  extension  based  on  a 
conduit  metaphor,  as  in  iloshka  'to  lie  to'  (cf.  loshka  'to  lie')  and  im-anompoli  'to  talk  to'  (cf. 
anompoli  'to  talk'),  or  even  imoshmoli  'to  wink  at'  (cf.  moshmoli  'to  wink').  With  these,  the 
addressee gains possession of the content of the communication.

3.8.3.  Non-locative loh is not case marking 

While non-locative loh exhibits certain features consistent with case marking (§3.8.3.1), overall 

its behavior does not seem consistent with case marking (3.8.3.2). 

 

3.8.3.1.  Ways in which non-locative loh is consistent with case marking 

There is a limited area in which non-locative loh seems consistent with case marking.  

Specifically, in pairs such as (138) and (139) it seems to be an optional marker on the object.  

Here, the object's presence in the sentence is licensed by the verb, as the grammaticality of 

(138b) and (139b) show.  (Also note that while (138b) was elicited based on the volunteered 

(138a), the situation is reversed for the pair in (139) with (139b) having been volunteered in a 

narration and (139a) elicited latet based on it.)  Loh, then, does not seem to be functioning as a 

preposition per se in (138a) and (139a)—in any case it does not seem to be licencing the 

presence of an additional participant, but rather to be marking a participant already licenced by 

the verb.

The same pattern exemplified above for TMZ also seems to exist to some extent in SLQZ, as 

I will discuss below.  However, for the verb ràann 'see', and other verbs of 'seeing', complements 

with loh are much more prototypical (Munro p.c.), as can be seen by the description from Cali 

Chiu which indicates the necessity of loh with verbs of seeing. 

 

ran lo [ràann loh] sees  
rgwi lo [rgwi'ih loh] looks at, watches, checks out 

Most Valley  Zapotec  expressions that refer to seeing  or looking at something express the noun 
phrase telling who or  what  was seen as the object of  the preposition  lo rather than as a regular 
object. Here are two of these verbs: 
 
 
 
The verb ran is quite irregular: its perfective is mna, and its irrealis is gan. 
 
These new verb phrases can be used in sentences like the following: 
 
  Mna Lia Len lua. 
 
 

"I see Pedro." 
"Elena saw me." 
"Are you watching television?" 
"Juan is going to go and look at the chickens." 

Rana lo Bed. 

Cagwiu lo telebisyony e? 
Chigwi Jwany lo ra budy. 

… 

In  these  expressions,  lo  does  not  mean  "on"  or  "in  front  of"  (though  you  usually  are  facing 
whatever you are looking at!). It is best just to think of it as part of the "seeing" verb. What would 
be  the  object  in  the  English  sentence  is  expressed  in  Zapotec  in  a  prepositional  phrase,  as  the 
object of the preposition lo.  

Munro, Lillehaugen, and Lopez in prep.: Lesson 18 

 
  However, there are instances where the general pattern presented above in (138) and (139) 

does seem to occur in SLQZ  as indicated by the dictionary definitions presented in Table 13.  

Here are two pairs of verbs: in both cases the presence of loh does not increase the valency of the 

verbs; i.e. loh does not seem to be licensing the presence of an additional participant, like a 

prototypical preposition.  In the case of rdèèi'dy, the meaning of the verb does not seem to 

change, either.  This seems much on par with the TMZ examples above: the presence of loh 

seems optional.  For the verb rguèe'by the presence of loh does seem to change the meaning of 

the verb slightly, although the valency is not changed.   

rdèèi'dy 

rguèe'by 

1. crosses (a street or 
border)... 
puts, rubs (something) on (a 
part of his or another 
person's body) 

rdèèi'dy lohoh 

crosses (a street or border) 

rguèe'by lohoh 

puts (grease, ointment, sun 
screen) on (something, another 
person) 

Table 13.  SLQZ verbs with loh prepositional objects: no increased valency 

(data from Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) 

 
 

231 

 

 
 

In addition this pattern is attested for other verbs in SLQZ as shown in Table 14.  However, 

these differ from those discussed above, in that the meaning of the verb with loh seems to be 

idiomatic, or at least not synchronically transparent.  What these have in common with all the 

other examples presented in this section, is that loh does not license the presence of an additional 

participant.  Instead, loh seems to be marking a participant already licensed by the verb.

Table 14.  SLQZ verbs with loh prepositional objects:  

 
 
3.8.3.2.  Ways in which non-locative loh is inconsistent with case marking 

While the examples presented in §3.8.3.1 apparently showed loh being used to mark certain kind 

of objects, most commonly non-locative loh is used to introduce additional participants in the 

sentence.  The pattern in (140) - (142) is typical of the behavior of non-locative loh.  In these 

case loh is used to license the presence of an additional participant: rrie'f 'raffle' (140a), x:na'ana' 

'my mother' (141a), and Jwaany 'John' (142a).  These participants are not licensed by the verb, as 

indicated by the ungrammaticality of (140b), (141b), and (142b).  Moreover, all three verbs are 

grammatical as a simple transitives (140c), (141c), and (142c).  The function of loh in these 

sentences seems to be to introduce this additional participant: the source of winning the radio 

(140a), the goal of sending the flowers (141a), and the person from whom the money was 

collected (142a).  This type of behavior makes non-locative loh look like a preposition and not a 

case marker.

Table 15.  SLQZ verbs with loh prepositional objects; increased valency  

(data from Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) 

 
Some verbs that follow this pattern seem to have a more idiomatic meaning, such as SLQZ rìi'an 

'remains, is located' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:270) and rìi'an biien lohoh 'acts nice to 

(someone, for personal gain)' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:270). 

 

Since the pattern presented in this section (i.e. non-locative loh licensing the presence of an 

additional participant) seems to be much more frequent than the pattern presented in §3.8.3.1 

(i.e. non-locative loh marking the object of a verb), I do not think there is sufficient evidence to 

conclude the non-locative loh is a case marker.  Nevertheless, the pattern exemplified in §3.8.3.1 

is worthy of further investigation. 

 

 
 

234 

 

3.8.4.  Is non-locative loh a dative preposition? 

While non-locative loh does not seem to best be characterized as a case marker, a question 

remains: is loh a dative preposition?  In the following sections I present ways in which the 

meaning of non-locative loh seems consistent with (§3.8.4.1) and inconsistent with (§3.8.4.2) the 

canonical dative uses, based on the characteristics presented by Loos et al. (1999), Blake (2001), 

and Gorbet and Munro (2002). 

 

3.8.4.1.  Ways in which non-locative loh is consistent with the dative 

Non-locative loh seems consistent with a dative meaning in certain of its uses.  It is used to mark 

some recipients (143). 

143.  B-x:èe'l=a'             gyììa'      
PERF-send=1SG    flower    
 
'I sent flowers to my mother' 

loh        
to     
 

x:-na'an=a'. (TMZ; 5:145a) (=128a) 
POSS-mother=1SG 

 
 
It can also be used to introduce some types of beneficiaries (144), but it has the additional 

 

requirement that the action be done in the presence of the beneficiary.  In this sense, which is not 

strictly locative, it seems to have a strong tie to the locative meaning 'in front of' and this 

meaning probably developed from that. 

144.  a. B-zhùu'azh=a'   
PERF-tear=1SG  
'I tore up the tortilla for (and in the presence of) the dog'

PERF-sing=1SG

x:-na'an=a' (TMZ) 
POSS-mother=1SG 

for     

Loh can also be used to mark participants that might be realized as indirect objects in some 

 
 
 
 
 

languages (145) and Table 16.

approaches (here, there)' and rbi'eg lohoh 'moves closer to' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999:225). 

 

Zapotec non-locative loh seems particularly like the Chickasaw dative applicative in that it is 

often used when the additional participant is human, as illustrated in the examples in Table 17.

3.8.4.2.  Ways in which non-locative loh is inconsistent with the dative 

While non-locative loh is used to mark many types of noun phrases that appear marked as dative 

cross-linguistically, there are some noticeable gaps.   

 

Loh is not used to mark the recipient with 'give' or verbs morphologically related to 'give' 

such as the compound verb 'give as a present' in (146).

(147) where the action of making the cake does not happen in the presence of the agent's mother.

Non-locative meanings of loh are also attested in CVZ, which exhibits both the modern TVZ 

non-locative meaning of loh (§3.8.5.1) and other non-locative meanings that do not seem to have 

been retained in modern TVZ (§3.8.5.2).

Additional types of goal meanings are exemplified below in (150).  Since paying someone or 

making an offering at a location usually involves being present in front of that person or location, 

this overlap in pragmatic usage could account for this type of meaning.

Loh also appears in the Colonial documents meaning 'from' (151) similar to the modern 

example repeated in (152). As with the example above, I believe that since asking or demanding 

 
 

239 

something from someone or collecting money from them usually involves being present in front 

of that person; this overlap in pragmatic usage could account for this meaning.

  Although it is sometimes difficult to understand the exact meaning of certain words in the

Colonial documents, the use of loh in (153) seems similar to me to the use of loh in modern TVZ 

shown in (154).  This use does not seem to be easily explained using the base of 'face' or 'in front 

of', however.  Additional explanation is needed to account for the meaning of loh in these cases.  

I will suggest in §3.8.6, that perhaps loh was a default preposition, especially in CVZ.

asked my main consultant how he might say this in Zapotec, he didn't know.  He felt he would 

just say the whole phrase in Spanish instead: "En el nombre del padre y del hijo y del espiritu 

santo…".  However, when I told him how it was said in CVZ, he offered (159b) and said that he 

remembered his grandmother saying this and that it sounded right.  I am not entirely sure of the 

status of this sentence; nevertheless it was offered and repeated several times by my consultant, 

so it seems to be grammatical, if perhaps antiquated.

In some cases, modern TVZ varieties differ in their use of non-locative loh.  For example, in 

(160a) CVZ loh could be translated using many English words: 'with', 'through', and 'in'.  While 

using loh in a construction like this seems possible in TMZ (160c) (alongside an alternative 

using a borrowed preposition (160b)), it is not possible in SLQZ.

Loh had a very broad meaning in the Colonial period.  While some of these non-locative 

 
 
 
 
 

 

meanings can be accounted for based on reanalysis from a locational meaning, others cannot.  

The non-locational meanings are suggestive that loh may have been grammaticized as a 

preposition in the Colonial period.  However, semantics alone is not a sufficient diagnostic for 

syntactic category, especially when it comes to component part locatives (Lillehaugen and 

Munro 2006).  Therefore, arguments relying on the CVZ syntax and morphology are needed.  

This is work that I plan to pursue. 

 

3.8.6.  Conclusions 

Although much work remains to be done on the meaning of non-locative loh in both modern and 

Colonial Valley Zapotec, I offer an hypothesis here for the range of meaning of this word, which 

might also explain the change (i.e. the decrease) in the range of meaning over the last few 

hundred years. 

 

It may have been the case that loh was a default oblique preposition.  This could account for 

the meanings that seem difficult to derive from any of the locative (or nominal) meanings, such 

as the one in (161).  Notice, also, that làa'any 'in', a locative preposition, cannot be substituted 

for loh here.  Perhaps this is because the relationship is not locative, per se, but some other 

oblique relationship that can only be grammatically expressed with loh.

  Viewing loh as a default oblique preposition could also account for overlap with some uses 

of a dative marker, since dative case has been described as "the unmarked oblique case" for 

German (Riemsdijk 1983:237).   

 

This also offers a possible explanation for the broader use of loh in CVZ.  It would seem that 

as TVZ languages began borrowing Spanish prepositions, these new prepositions have taken 

over roles previously assigned to the "default" loh.  

 

3.9.  Child acquisition of component part locatives 

In this section I give evidence from the child language acquisition of TVZ that component part 

locatives in TVZ can be acquired independently from their related referential component part 

terms.  This suggests that at least for children, the meanings of some component part locatives 

are not necessarily synchronically derived from their corresponding referential component parts. 

 

This paper reports the results of a pilot study of two children acquiring SLQZ, ages 1;6 and 

2;3.21  The study is described in full detail in Lillehaugen 2003 and portions of this section has 

appear previously in Lillehaugen 2003 and 2004c.  The children's knowledge of the meanings of 

both the referential component parts and the component part locatives was tested using a forced 

choice, picture identification task. The data suggest that the component part locatives are 

                                                 
21 Ages are given in the following format: years;months(;days). For example, and 2;3 stands for two years 
and three months old and 1;6;14 stands for one year, six months, and fourteen days old. 

 
 

244 

 

acquired as independent grammatical elements and their acquisition is not related to the 

acquisition of the corresponding referential component parts.  This dissociation between the 

acquisition of the component part locatives and the referential component parts supports my 

hypothesis that some locative terms are not synchronically metaphorical extensions of the 

nominal forms, as some locatives can be acquired without the referential component part nouns 

having been acquired. These results are consistent with an analysis of component part locatives 

as prepositions.   

 
3.9.1.  Participants and methodology of SLQZ child language acquisition pilot study 

Here I present the results of two children tested in the pilot study: Vanesa (1;6) and Andrea (2;3). 

At the time, Vanesa was learning SLQZ as her primary language and also had Spanish input. 

Andrea was learning both SLQZ and Spanish as her first languages.  

 

In order to test the children's understanding of referential component parts and component 

part locatives, two forced-choice picture identification tasks were designed testing the eight 

words listed in Table 1. Each word was tested twice in each task; 16 questions for referential 

component parts and 16 questions for component part locatives for a total of 32 questions. The 

tests were run twice, on separate occasions.22 

                                                 
22  The children were tested in their home during two sessions in March 2001. I was present during the 
tests, as were Silvia Lopez and sometimes the child's mother. S. Lopez is a native speaker of SLQZ and 
has worked as a linguistic consultant with Munro and me.  Only one child was present during the test. The 
child was asked if she wanted to play a game. S. Lopez explained the game by saying that the child would 
hear a question while looking at the book, and she was to pick the picture that answered the question and 
every time she answered she would get a sticker. Previous to this study, I had observed the children for 
another project so they all knew me and were used to speaking Zapotec in front of me.  
  The pictures used in the tests are all black and white line drawings. All but one of the pictures used in 
these tests were adapted from Curtiss and Yamada (1987).  The picture for làa'any 'stomach' was drawn 
for me by Melissa Tai in the style of the Curtiss and Yamada (1987) pictures.

   Along with each question the child was shown two pictures (one that corresponded to the 

question being asked, and one that did not). For example,  the child was shown a picture of a foot 

and a picture of a head, in Figure 106 below, and was asked Cu'an gue'ehcy bùunny? 'Where is 

the person's head?'  The picture on the right (a head) corresponds correctly to the question, 

whereas the picture on the left (a foot) does not. 

Figure 106. sample picture pair for referential component part test 

 

 

 

A pre-test was conducted before the body part test, which introduced the child to the forced 

choice task. During this section, if the child was unresponsive after being asked the question, 

Silvia Lopez modeled how to choose a picture by pointing at the correct picture. This established 

the task of choosing and the method of choosing: pointing. Furthermore, the pre-test was used to 

introduce some of the pictures that would be used later in the body part locative test.  The child's 

success in the pre-test showed that she could recognize the pictures and understood the task. As 

 
 

246 

 

in the test itself, all answers given by the child were rewarded with verbal praise and a sticker 

regardless of whether the answer was correct or not.  

During the referential component part test, each body part was tested twice, once with the 

correct answer on the left and the other with correct answer on the right, to control for the 

children having a bias for one side or another. Each body part was paired with a different 

distracter body part for the two trials. The question asked of the children for each pair was Cu'an 

____ bùunny? 'Where is the person's ___?'  (Recall that in SLQZ unpossessed body parts are 

generally ungrammatical. Cu'an ni'ih? 'Where is the foot?', would be viewed as awkward at 

best.) 

As with the referential component parts, each component part locative was tested twice. Each 

time it was tested, it was tested opposite a different locative relationship and the matching picture 

occurred on different sides in each trial.  In addition, the type of positional verb used had to be 

controlled for. Unlike in English, there is no single TVZ verb, like is, that can be used in any 

type of simple locative sentence, such as The book is on the table, or The ball is beside the chair. 

Instead there are a small number of positional verbs that can be used (see Chapter 5 for more of 

positional verbs).  In this test, five positional verbs were used.23  In order to ensure that the only 

difference between the matching and non-matching pictures was the preposition, I chose pictures 

that could be described using the same verb, as verified by a native speaker.  The question asked 

of the children for each pair was on the model: Cu'an FIGURE  nih VERB PREP GROUND? 

'Where is the FIGURE that is PREP GROUND?'; for example, Cu'an bèe'cw nih zùub ni'ih 

                                                 
23 Bèe'b 'is located on' [usually a raised surface]; nàa'tga'ah 'is lying down, is (located) in a lying 
position'; nu'uh 'exists (in a location)' [often has a habitual sense]; zuu 'is standing, is located (standing)'; 
zùub 'is sitting; is located, exists (sitting or projecting)' (Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999).

me'es? 'Where is the dog that is under the table?' and Cu'an ta's nih zùub loh me'es? 'Where is 

the cup that is on the table?'24  

The following is a sample picture pair from the component part preposition test. The 

corresponding question to Figure 107 is Cu'an bèe'cw nih zùub ni'ih me'es? 'Where is the dog 

that is under the table?'  (The picture on the right corresponds correctly with the question.)

3.9.2.  Results 

A child was counted as knowing a certain word if she answered correctly for that word more 

often than they answered incorrectly. Because of the limited data, the results were not tested for 

statistical significance.25  Therefore the results can only be interpreted as suggesting trends.  

  Andrea (2;3) demonstrated knowledge of 7 of the 8 referential body parts tested: cwe'eh 'side' 

and làa'iny 'stomach' were identified correctly 4 out of 4 times; gue'ehcy 'head', lohoh 'face', ni'ih 

'foot', and zh:ààa'n 'bottom' 3 out of 4 times; ru'uh 'mouth' was identified correctly 2 out of 3 

times. She demonstrated knowledge of 4 of the 8 component part locatives: làa'iny 'in' and 

zh:ààa'n 'behind' she answered correctly 4 out of 4 times; lohoh 'on, in front of' and ni'ih 'under' 

she answered correctly 3 out of 4 times. 

                                                 
24 I wanted to choose a question that was syntactically relatively uncomplicated while still natural. Upon 
consultation with Munro and S. Lopez, I decided that this question, though containing a relative clause, 
was the most natural way to ask the question.  
25 I hope to be able to replicate this study later with more participants. 

 
 

248 

 

  Vanesa (1;6) demonstrated knowledge of 3 of the 8 referential body parts tested: gue'ehcy 

'head' was identified correctly 4 out of 4 times; dehts 'back' and lohoh 'face' 3 out of 4 times. She 

demonstrated knowledge of 5 of the 8 component part locatives: cwe'eh 'beside', lohoh 'on, in 

front of', dehts 'behind' were identified correctly 4 out of 4 times;  ni'ih 'under' 3 out of 4 times; 

làa'iny 'in' 2 out of 3 times. 

 

The acquisition of the referential component  parts and the component part locatives can be 

classified into four patterns.  In Patterns 1 and 2 either both the referential component part noun 

and the component part locative have been acquired or neither of them have.  Patterns 3 and 4, 

on the other hand, exhibiting a dissociation between the acquisition of the referential component 

part and the component part locative.  In these patterns one of the terms have been acquired but 

the other one has not. 

 

In Pattern 1 neither the referential component part nor the component part locative have been 

acquired: e.g. dehts 'back' and 'behind' (Andrea).  In Pattern 2 both the referential component part 

and the component part locative have been acquired: e.g. dehts 'back' and 'behind' (Vanesa).  

 

In Pattern 3 the referential component part has been acquired, but the component part 

locative has not. Examples of this include cwe'eh 'side' (Andrea), gue'ehcy 'head' (Vanesa, 

Andrea), and ru'uh 'mouth' (Andrea). An analysis of all component part locatives as having 

metaphorically extended meanings would have a difficult time accounting for this dissociation. 

Both of the children had acquired some component part locatives for which they had also 

acquired the corresponding referential component part (Pattern 2). If all component part locative 

meanings are derived through metaphor, then the fact that the children showed adult 

comprehension for some pairs might suggest that they have also acquired the metaphor "tools" 

they need.  An analysis of component part locatives as nouns with metaphorically derived 

 
 

249 

 

meaning would have to account for the ability of the children to apply the metaphor in some 

cases, and their inability to apply it in others. 

 

Finally, in Pattern 4 the component part locative has been acquired, but the referential 

component part has not: cwe'eh 'beside' (Vanesa); làa'iny 'in' (Vanesa); ni'ih 'under' (Vanesa). An 

analysis of the meaning of all component part locatives as metaphorically extended meanings 

could not account for this dissociation. If all locative meanings are based upon the referential 

body part nominal meaning, how could the child acquire the locative meaning without also 

having acquired the referential noun?  If, instead, the component part locatives are prepositions, 

as I argue, this dissociation is in fact expected. One would predict that the referential body part 

nouns would be acquired the way children acquire nouns, and that the component part 

prepositions would be acquired in the same order as children acquire prepositions. 

 

Table 19 summarizes this data; the cells that show a dissociation between the acquisition of 

the referential component part and the component part locative have been shaded.

3.9.3.  Child language acquisition data from SMTZ 

There are other data that further substantiate the dissociation between the referential component 

part nouns and prepositions in the acquisition of Zapotec. Jensen de López (2002) reports the 

results of a longitudinal study of one child acquiring San Marcos Tlapazola Zapotec (SMTZ) 

(from age 1;3 to 2;9). At the end of this study,  the child reportedly used four of the component 

part terms in locative constructions: láani 'in' and quia 'on' (as of 2;0;12); lo 'on' (as of 2;3;23); 

and dets 'behind' (as of 2;6). 

 

Jensen de López (1999) reported data from the same SMTZ acquiring child at age 2;9.  By 

this time, the child is reported to use one additional component part term in locative 

constructions: ruu 'at the edge of.'  In Table 20 I present Jensen de López's (1999) data, showing 

for each component part whether the child used that term as a referential body part meaning or as 

a locative.

The SMTZ acquisition data also show two types of dissociation within the acquisition of 

component part nouns and prepositions; these cells are marked with shading. Pattern 3, the 

acquisition of the referential component part but not the component part locative, can be seen for 

nii 'foot' and Pattern 4, the acquisition of the component part locative but not the referential body 

part, can be seen for làani  'in'; quia 'on'; ruu 'at the edge of'; dets 'behind'. These results are 

consistent with the data found in my pilot study. 

 

3.9.4.  Comparison with cross-linguistic acquisition of prepositions 

How does the acquisition of Zapotec prepositions compare with the acquisition of prepositions in 

other languages?  Cross-linguistically, the first prepositions to be acquired are 'in' and 'on', then 

                                                 
26 The SMTZ data are presented in the orthography used by Jensen de López (1999, 2002).

'under' and 'beside', then 'front' and 'back' of things that have inherent fronts and backs, and 

finally 'front' and 'back' of things with no inherent fronts or backs, as exemplified by several
